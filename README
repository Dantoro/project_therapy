# Project Therapy

**Project Therapy** is an open, modular research platform for building next-generation, emotionally intelligent chatbots.  
It combines state-of-the-art natural language processing, emotion detection, and memory management into a single, extensible system—ideal for experimentation in AI-powered therapy, mental health support, or advanced conversational research.

---

## Quick Overview

- **Emotion-Aware:** Uses transformer-based classification (GoEmotions, 28 classes) and advanced trend tracking to monitor user emotion in real time.
- **Memory-Augmented:** Employs both short- and long-term conversational memory, combining detailed recent exchanges with high-level summaries of session history.
- **Modular:** Each core component (emotion classifier, memory, trend tracker, chatbot, etc.) can be swapped or extended independently.
- **Research-Ready:** Designed for easy prototyping, clear documentation, and transparency.

## Key Features

- **EmotionClassifier:**  
  - Cleans and analyzes user input at the character level (BiGRU), then classifies emotions using a transformer autoencoder trained on GoEmotions (28 categories, multi-label).
  - Outputs a 28D probability vector, tracks per-class derivatives, and maintains an EMA-based emotional trend.

- **MemoryModule:**  
  - **STM (Short-Term Memory):** Holds the last 10 user/bot exchanges, providing rich context for reasoning and summarization.
  - **LTM (Long-Term Memory):** Stores summaries of prior conversations as "blocks," rotating as needed for efficient scaling.
  - **TrendTracker:** Lightweight, real-time emotion tracking with nonlinear recency bias via EMA (all 28D vectors).

- **HAN (Hierarchical Attention Network):**  
  - Deep context modeling of recent conversation using GloVe (300d), custom word2vec (350d, trained on clinical dialogues), and learned embeddings (374d, from GoEmotions); concatenated and projected to 512d at model input.

- **Pipeline:**  
  - At each user turn, the system fuses STM, LTM, trend signals, and HAN output to drive decision-making and response generation.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (details to come as code is released)
2. **See** `ideas/component_specific_ideas/emotion_classifier_logic.md` and `memory_module_logic.md` for detailed documentation of the core pipeline.
3. **Check** `ideas/simple_emotion_trend_algorithm_plan.md` for the math, rationale, and pseudocode behind the TrendTracker module.
4. **Legacy** designs and experiments live in `ideas/legacy_ideas/` for historical reference and inspiration.
