# Project Therapy

**A multi-stage, modular AI project for building a therapeutic chatbot with emotion understanding and memory.**

---

## Overview

Project Therapy is an experiment in modern NLP architectures for emotion classification and emotionally-aware conversational agents.  
This project aims to build a robust, extensible pipeline including:

- **Emotion Classification:** BiLSTM-based, using SBERT sentence embeddings, attention, and deep dense stacks.
- **Short-Term Emotion Memory:** Nonlinear rolling trend (EMA) over recent emotions.
- **Long-Term Conversational Memory:** Sequence-to-sequence "block" summarization for context compression.
- **Chatbot Engine:** Decoder-only transformer (GPT-style), driven by both memory modules and a decision strategy.

---

## Folder Structure

- `beginner_mode/`  
  Early prototyping and first-pass emotion classifier work.
- `ideas/`  
  Architecture diagrams, high-level design docs, trend algorithm plans, and data flow descriptions.
- `save_for_when_i_have_bigger_data/`  
  Prototype code and model drafts for future, more ambitious phases.

## Key Design Files

- **Emotion Classifier**: `dummy_structure_of_BiLSTM.py` (see also visual/text breakdowns)
- **System Design**:  
  - `ideas/block_diagram_v2.md` (latest architecture diagram)
  - `ideas/structure_description.md` (bulleted structure and data flow)
  - `ideas/simple_emotion_trend_algorithm_plan.md` (trend-tracking logic)

## Status

- Active **design & planning** phase.
- Emotion classifier model next up for coding and experimentation in `beginner_mode/`.
- All architectures subject to change as research continues.
