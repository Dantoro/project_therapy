# Project Therapy

A multi-stage NLP/NLU research project, with the goal of building a mental health/therapy chatbot. This repo features:

- A deep emotion classifier (BiLSTM/HAN-based) using transformer-based sentence embeddings.
- Plans for short-term and long-term conversational memory modules.
- Decision logic and generative response modules for real-time, emotionally-aware conversation.

**Current State:**  
- Architecture and planning files for both baseline and advanced models.
- Preprocessed emotion dataset for early prototyping.

**Upcoming:**  
- EDA notebook for dataset analysis.
- Training scripts and model experiments.

## Folder Structure

- `beginner_mode/` — baseline dataset and models
- `ideas/` — folder for big picture plans that are larger than any one component of the project 
- `save_for_when_i_have_bigger_data/` — planned/advanced architectures and pseudocode
