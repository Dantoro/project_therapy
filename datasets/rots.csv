1,Anakin,I saw your ship. What are you doing out here?
2,Padme,I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
3,Anakin,What things?
4,Padme,He said you've turned to the Dark Side. That you... killed younglings.
5,Anakin,Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
6,Padme,He cares about us.
7,Anakin,Us?
8,Padme,"He knows. He wants to help you. Anakin, all I want is your love."
9,Anakin,"Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that."
10,Padme,"At what cost? You're a good person, don't do this!"
11,Anakin,I won't lose you the way I lost my mother. I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of. And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.
12,Padme,Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can!
13,Anakin,"Don't you see? We don't HAVE to run away anymore. I have brought PEACE to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor, I—I can overthrow him! And together, you and I can rule the galaxy, make things the way we want them to be!"
14,Padme,"I don't believe what I'm hearing... Obi-Wan was right, you've changed!"
15,Anakin,I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me—don't YOU turn against me!
16,Padme,"I don't know you anymore... Anakin, you're breaking my heart! You're going down a path I can't follow."
17,Anakin,Because of Obi-Wan?
18,Padme,Because of what you've done... what you plan to do. Stop. Stop now! Come back... I love you!
19,Anakin,LIAR!
20,Padme,No!
21,Anakin,You're with HIM! You brought him here to KILL me!
22,Padme,No! ... Anakin...
