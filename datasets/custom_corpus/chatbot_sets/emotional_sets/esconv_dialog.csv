Hello,"Hello, how are you doing?"
I am hanging in there as well as I can be,What's been going on?
I am worried about losing my job. The company I work for has had layoffs and is talking about it again in a few months. This makes me really nervous,It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.
It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that.,"Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. It must be frustrating knowing the safe path was taken but even then jobs might be taken away for something out of your control."
Yes! Exactly and I cannot stand that. I love my routine and predicability.,I can relate to that. It's always nice when everything falls into place. The prospect of a sudden change stresses me out and I imagine you've been feeling the same way as well. What's your fear if you lose your job?
"Very much so. If I lose my job I can't pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. In a good economy it took me over 300 applications, 50 interviews, and over 6 months to find a job.","I think even if you lose your job, you would still be able to obtain resources through unemployment or even a stay at home temporary job from an employment agency while you look for another one or for your company to return to normal."
I would hope so,I can definitely relate. I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :) You have every right to feel the way you do though. It's a scary time but know that things will be okay.
Right. It's just not something I want to go through again. I just got this job 18 months ago. That job hunting dread and feeling hasn't gone away.,"I understand. It definitely is an agonizing process but you've gone through it before and have 18 months of experience under your belt from your current job which looks good on any resume. Despite the pandemic, I think this will help make things a lot easier for you."
"For the record, you are doing a really really good job. I really appreciate your time and kind words. Thank you for empathizing and relating. I appreciate your assistance. I feel a lot better about this now :)",You are very welcome. (: It's my pleasure to help in any way I can.
hello,"Hello, how are you doing today?"
I'm doing good and you,"I'm doing alright, thank you. I'm here for you if you'd like to tell me about anything going on in your life."
I need money to celebrate xmas and new year on a big party I friends and girl friend that I need to take out for this xmas,A lot of people are in a tight bind right now with money... myself included. Do you need money to buy presents?
yes and for party,Where do you want to take your friends and girlfriend?
"around my town, Just to enjoy ourselves for this new year celebration I am even bordered, I don' t like to be broke",That is very sweet of you. Is there a more affordable place you can take them? That is very sweet of you. Is there a more affordable place you can take them?
they will not like those small places,"It doesn't feel good to not have enough money to do the things you could normally do, but I'm sure that the people around you will be understanding. Do you live somewhere hot or cold? Maybe you can plan something based on enjoying nature."
"yes oo, you are right cold","It seems like you feel like you will be a disappointment to your loved ones if you can't provide a special holiday celebration for them, is that right?"
"You know, it s a kind of tradition what you normally do every year, this year now, you refuse to do anything, think of how they will feel yes, you are getting my point","You might be surprised how your loved ones will react though. I think a lot of times it is more about the effort & time that you put into planning something. People will see the effort that you make, you seem very sweet."
I need a means to get instant money to hold the party,How big of a party will it be?
neutral party of 1000 dollars,"That seems like a lot of money to get quick, what part of the party will cost the most money?"
We normally hold a club party,Maybe this year you could have a party in your home? And cook a lot of delicious food & ask people to bring their own drinks
"or may be I should borrow money and refund it later ,afte the year celebration","It sounds like you have to decide whether the party is important enough to borrow money for. Its been such a hard year for everyone, that a party could be good to raise everyone's spirits. However it could make your financial situation worse."
"okay I will look for a way out, if no means , I will do a parlor party as u said thanks for your time bye",Don't be afraid to ask the people you love for help! Bye
I'm qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else,"It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn't willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right?"
Yes that's right. It's frustratgn *frustrating,"Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co-worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective."
Unfortunately I can't really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue,Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered?
The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further,I'm sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated.
"Thanks, that's good to hear",I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion.
It's hard to be positive when I feel like my manager is not receptive to my opinions and just trusts the feedback given by this one other person,"I've worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co-workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn't be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth."
Maybe it is time for me to start looking elsewhere for better opportunities. I've worked at this place so long that I have become comfortable here and the thought of searching for a new job is intimidating,"You've got this! It's easy to become comfortable in what we know but, change causes us to grow."
"Yeah I agree, it's uncomfortable and difficult though! I haven't searched for a new job in so long, I feel like I will perform terribly at the interviews",Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose. I also think we all feel like we perform badly during interviews. Preparation is key. I hope discussing your work situation today has made you feel a bit better!
"It has, thanks for being supportive and listening to my problem",It was my pleasure! Thank you for sharing with me. I'm glad I had the opportunity.
Hello,Hi how are you?
Im not doing very well at all.,What's going on?
I am very stressed out with my work. I feel like I am being over worked but I also feel stuck at this job.,I know the feeling. what do you do for work?
I am a lab assistant.,how long have you been in your role? and do you have any coworkers that feel similar to you that you know about?
I have been in this role for about a year. I am the only one at this level. I take care of a lot of the productivity and logistical work. Im just really stressed recently,"Somewhat similarly I'm in a supply chain role, for a year now, and the only one at my level too. I often feel like I'm alone in my job and that I manage my boss... It's pretty frustrating. is there anything that makes your job less stressful?"
I think that being able to have a better work life balance would help but I have a hard time talking to my boss.,do you think your boss would be receptive if you did talk to them? or would they dismiss your concerns?
I am unsure. They are very much all about work. I am afraid they wont see my point and understand my want for a better work life balance.,This has been a pretty hard year for everyone. however you ultimately gotta do whats best for you. Have you considered searching for a new job?
I have but it is hard to find a job at this time. I also really like what I do but wish I could have more balance. Do you have any advice for how to balance stress at work and your life outside of work?,"I'm in the same boat. I would say, the things that work best for me, are to take breaks during my work day and go for walks or as soon as I'm done with work I force myself to go for a walk. I find moving helps me feel better. I also use that time to think about how I can look for a new job or rethink the things that are bothering me maybe you can try something similar?"
I think I could try that. I have a hard time detaching from work especially working from home. I feel like I never really 'leave' the office. I am always working even when I normally wouldnt be.,"Change the scenery, it'll help! plus movement releases endorphins which make you feel better."
Thank you! I will try that.,no problem!
Hello,Hello! How are you doing?
I am anxious,I'm sorry to hear that. What is the cause of your anxiety?
My friends and my family place a lot of value on how one looks. Every time I meet with them they have a comment on how I should improve on something. It makes me stressed out because I feel like I am not good enough.,I am sorry you are having to deal with this. Are you concerned about your own looks because you constantly hear this feedback from those close to you?
"Yes. I feel that I am not thin enough, pretty enough, that my clothes are not nice enough etc",I myself have gone through similar feelings when I was a teenager. I had body image issues for the longest time and my way of resolving it was through proper diet and exercise. Are you happy with how you look personally irrespective of what others opinions are?
It is hard to feel ok when I keep hearing that I am missing something. I don't even think I need to lose weight. It is just that my friends think model thin is what beauty is. I would have to starve myself to achieve that.,If you are comfortable with your weight then why are you so concerned with what everyone around you says or thinks?
Because they are the people I spend time with. I want to be accepted and I want them to like me.,It sounds like you care more about what others think of you than how you feel about yourself.
I wish I could not care about what they think but I do. I don't know how to not let their opinions not bother me,Have you ever tried affirmations or heard of this before?
No. What is that?,Affirmations are positive statements you think about yourself. What I like to do when I'm feeling really anxious is say three positive things/attributes I feel about myself over and over again until my anxiety dissipates. Do you think that could help you feel more positively about what those closest to you are saying so much with regards to looks?
I could try. Do I need to say positive things about my looks or can they be about other stuff?,"Since you are stating that you are concerned about how you look, you should just find a few positive statements with regards to your looks you think about yourself and repeat them. So if you don't think you need to lose weight, you can say something like, ""I like my weight."" or ""I don't need to lose weight."" If you think you are beautiful or pretty, you can say ""I am beautiful."" My three affirmations I use for myself are: I am beautiful, smart, and funny. I say this over and over again until my anxiety has left me."
That sounds easy enough. I will definitely try it. It will take my mind off of worrying about what they are thinking.,I highly recommend it! Is there anything else bothering you that I can help with?
No you gave me a great suggestion to work with. Thank you so much for your help!,No problem! Glad I could help. I hope you have a wonderful day and take care!
You too. Bye now.,Bye!
Hello.,"Hi there, How are you doing today?"
I am angry today.,Would you like to go into the reasons for why you are angry?
I guess. I have a friend that is being really annoying and dismissive. I feel like they're not being a good friend.,Do they act this way often?
"Not really, we were talking recently and she just didn't really want to hear my opinion and talked over me. Normally she's pretty good at listening.","Well, everyone, including yourself, is entitled to an off day. Maybe something is going on with her she doesnt want to share. Or possibly even she is trying to share but doesnt know how."
I guess that could be the case. What should I do then?,Perhaps try to reach out and see if anything is wrong.
So I should just ask her if something is going on?,"I would remember though, its ok for people to want to be left alone though if things are bad, sometimes they just need their space."
"Ok, that makes sense, I can get like that. What if something isn't wrong though?","I would just say something along the lines of: Hey, youre not acting like yourself today, anything you want to talk about? I would see if there is anything you can do to help, if not just try and be as supportive as you can."
"Ok, that sounds like a good plan. I'm just a little worried that it won't work because she was acting really rude. So I feel like I don't really want to talk to her right now.","Well, youre own health and well being does come first. If you feel it wont get anywhere, give her some space and come back to it at another date if you think you both would be comfortable with it."
Okay. I think that sounds good. I'll give myself and hopefully her some time to calm down and then maybe ask if she want's to talk?,That sounds like a solid plan.
Thank you for helping! I feel a lot less upset and like I have an actual plan. You really helped me see that something could be going on with her that made her act so rude.,"I am glad i could help! Yeah, everyone including me, forgets that each individual has their own sets of things going on each day. Always good to look at it through their eyes a bit."
"Yeah, I think it's hard to do that when you're upset too.",It definitely is. I guess thats what makes us human though. Take care!
Hi!,Good Afternoon. How are you doing today?
"I am having a sad day today. My mothers new husband passed 3 weeks ago because of Corona, Now, yesterday my best friend passed of old age. This is the worst time for all of this. I am reeling with grief!",That sounds terrible. I can understand why you're sad today. That's a lot to take in around the holidays.
I am afraid to get another puppy. Yes you are right it is TOO much! I do not know how to deal. It seems everyone I talk to is going through a horrendous time with this virus and all the horrible predicaments it is putting people in. I am trying not to be selfish with my feelings knowing everyone else is having a bad time too...but DAMN! It almost is too much to take.... Should I get another puppy riht away? I feel very lonely without him.,Getting a new puppy might be a way to make you feel happy during this dark time in your life.
"I work at home now and I have a husband who does the same. Also my two kids got o school online. They are sad as well, but everyone knows he was my bestie,",It might be just what you need to have something to wake up and look forward to each day. Especially during times like now when everyone is spending so much time alone inside.
It is a spot not filled by humans. Yes. I suppose. Maybe even two would be better.,I completely agree. Having a dog as a companion has been a life saver to me in so many situations.
I would want him to have a friend this time. What kind of dog do you have?,Having a playmate for the dog will make it easier to justify leaving when you do need to go back to work in the office. The puppy won't be lonely. I have a yellow lab! He's great!
I hope to get a dog who enjoys working out with me like he did. Oh and I am not going back into an office! Not for awhile...probably not forever. I do have the option of staying home and working indefinetly so I am grateful for that.,I'd suggest a dog with a lot of energy if you like to workout! What kind of dog did you have previously?
I like being here watching over my kids and pets. I think I will stay working at home.,"Just from talking to you, it sounds like working from home is a great fit for you!"
"Pomeranian....he really didn't work out with me:), just running, jumping , and keeping up with my energy....doing what doggies do. His energy was happiness to me.",Pomeranians are such cute dogs! They always look like they're smiling! And they're small enough that having two won't be crowded!
I appreciate your feedback. I think that having two pomeranians this time is a good idea....and you are right they are always smiling! You have boosted my mood and made me feel hopeful. I thank you!,I'm glad that I could help you! I hope your new puppies bring you much happiness! I think they will boost your spirits a lot!
I am also going to stay at home while working for peace of mind. I hope you have a great new year. Stay safe! Goodbye!,Have a great new year! Bye!!
Hi there,"Hello, how are you today"
I've been better. I have to give a presentation at work on a stage. This is causing me a lot of stress and problems sleeping,What about giving a presentation gave you stress?
It is the thought of getting nervous in front of people and forgetting what I want to say.,"Have you taken steps to help you overcome this fear, such as rehearsing in front of the mirror or in front of another person?"
I have learned my lines and practiced at home a lot. I know what to say almost word for word but I had a bad experience in the past that has scared me.,"I understand giving presentations is nervewrecking, but at least you are trying. Are you allowed to take a few notecards just in case?"
"Thanks for understanding, yeah I suppose I could take notes. I think it is being in front of people and looking foolish that I'm scared of the most. I know a lot of people at work and don;t want them to think I'm bad on stage. Can you related to that?",I can definitely relate. It is best to look past the audience and just focus on an object close by. Everyone of us have had to experience this. You are not alone.
"Hopefully I can try to get past the nerves, some people make it look easy. I'm usually really confident but something about standing on a stage makes me feel very scared and anxious.","Before you go on, try taking a few deep breaths. Why not try meditating a few days before?"
I could do I suppose. I won't be the only one presenting that day so I feel like I won't be able to measure up against the other people on stage.,"Try shifting the focus on what could go wrong, to what could go right? Focus on others congratulating you on a job well done."
Yeah I do have a tendency to be negative sometimes and make a big deal out of things. I should actually focus on the good things. Has this technique helped you in the past?,"Yes, in the term ""fake it until you make it."" I keep on thinking of what could go right, or in my favor, and when I am done, it actually went okay, and any ""fears"" i had, never came to fruition."
I think that is really good advice. I think I have just suffered from a bad experience in the past and this has shaped my way of thinking to always be fearful. I'm fine in meetings or virtually but something about a stage just scares me.,"That's understandable. But now that you're aware, you have the steps the move forward and be successful."
yes I don't want it to hold me back personally or professionally any more,I believe you can do it.
hey thanks that really helps,HOpe you ace your presentation.
Hi..how are you today Iam looking for some help towards facing breakup with the partner can you help me providing some emotional support Is there anything that I can do to be get out of the sadness in my life,Absolutely. Tell me more about it. When did it happen?
it happened about a week ago..my boyfriend is being very possessive about everything I do I find it not convincing and broke up with him,I see. Were you living with your boyfriend? How was your life post breakup?
ye since an year..Iam feeling an emptyness in my life Do you suggest anything to come out of this,"I am sorry to hear that. It must be difficult. I have gone through a lot of breakups in my life too, and I know what you are going through."
yeah how do you manage after your breakup,Has the sadness eased over time in the past year? Were you consciously taking some measures to get over the stage?
Yeah iam implementing of taking a new hobby which is distracting me a little,"On average it takes me about a year to get over this. I feel like there is no better person for me, I don't know what the future brings, and I am imaging all the scenarios where past relationships could have been successful for me. I took a lot of walks and spent a lot of time with friends."
yeah those are two good strategies to follow..I will be considering them Do you have used any counselling?,I didn't. I wasn't able to afford them. I actually felt bad about venting the situation to my friends. They offered a lot of emotional support and I am sure they didn't want to seeing me like this. Do you have a support system in place? Are you considering getting counseling?
Even I cannot affod a counsellor..But Iam too embarraseed to talk to my friends.. Yes ..Iam thinking about getting a counselling do you know any best counsellors,"I am glad that you are preemptive about it. I think one year in, if you still constantly think about it, a counseling session would help you get closure. Even if it is a one session, you can always assess after trying this out. My current company actually offers free counseling session if I want to, I understand it is called ""One Medical""?"
yeah thank you for the help..is there any other strategies i can follow,"I also took up a lot of volunteering. It gives me a purpose and a group to belong to, where I can start fresh, have no baggages and meet new people."
Yeah i think i will start fresh from tomorrow..Do you have any ideas about choosing next partner..,"I am not familiar with the dating situation in pandemic time. I would say take it slow. If it is a right partner for you, it will make you a better person."
yeah sure..I will take it slow..I think that will help me,I am glad that we are able to chat. I hope things can start working out for you and you are able to move on to a new chapter of life.
Yeah thank you for your help..I appreciate it.. I hope you have a wonderful day..Stay safe and healthy.,Thank you. You too. I wish you all the best.
Hello,"Hi, How are you?"
I am feeling down and scared.,What is having you feel scared at this moment?
The ongoing pandemic and my financial situation. I am unemployed and I don't know when I will be able to get a job.,"Not having a job can feel overwhelming, especially on top of this pandemic. Have you been able to apply for work recently?"
Yes I have been applying but have not gotten any responses. I imagine a lot of people are competing for jobs.,you are right about others looking for work too. Are you signed up with many job seeking apps?
I have not been using apps. I use websites and look for jobs there. It is making me feel like I am not qualified enough.,Feelings of insufficiency can be such a stumbling block when looking for work. It is obvious that you are putting forth great effort. Do you think getting in contact with a job agency in your area would be beneficial to you?
I have not contacted a job agency. I don't have experience with them. That is a good idea.,"Perhaps there are a few agencies in your area to help and you can maximize your opportunities. You mentioned feeling down in the beginning of the conversation, would you like to talk about that?"
Yes I am going to look. It will increase my chances of finding work. It doesn't help that I live with my parents and because I have no work I spend most of my time at home and get into arguments with them.,"Tension can be high when you already feel stressed about the job situation. When I am feeling especially low or tense, I find that helping others significantly helps my disposition. Would volunteering be something that appeals to you?"
It would probably be good to volunteer to get out of the house. I think I will do that once the pandemic restrictions ease.,That would be great! There may also be opportunities to help out online until we can be more free to move around safely. It is important to be safe for us and others.
Can you think of any online volunteering opportunities? You have been very helpful so far.,"I know that there are many different opportunities available. If you google ""places to volunteer online"", they will have a list. Including places like The Smithsonian and Crisis Text Line."
Great. I will try that today. Thank you so much for your help.,"You are more than welcome.!! I expect life to start looking up for you. Best wishes, I'm glad we spoke."
I hope so. I better go get started on the suggestions you gave me. Thanks again and have a great day.,you too
hello,Hello. How are you?
"I need to confide on someone, I just need to say it out so I can be relieve we met on instagram","Sure, you can tell me anything. I won't judge or anything like that."
"that bitchtold me that she is from Cananda, and she will soon come to USA, i do tell her I love her, she will send different naked pictures of herself, I did'nt know she is a bitch she fuck defraud me with almost 4000$ before I know, she requested for my bank details last two weeks my bank called me to come that someone is trying to access my account","Oh dear, that sounds like a classic love fraud.... I'm so sorry you were victimized like that."
I called her no not reacheable chatted her up not replyig,"Oh my. I hate to hear that. Bank details should never be given out to people you don't know. This person made you think they cared about you, but they were trying to earn your trust and gain access to your accounts from the start."
"she is a bitch I was lost thanks to my bank manager, that make my eyes to open","That person is just a scammer. They probably reach out to hundreds of potential victims every day, waiting for someone to bite. I'm sorry you were taken in by them. Were you able to recover any of your loss?"
i can believe now if u tell me two months ago I will never accept what you are saying thanks for your time,Scams like that have been going on for years. They just change how they go about it and what platform they use. You're very welcome. Please be more careful in future.
okay bye,I do hope you were able to recover your loss. I wish you luck and hope you can find someone honest and true.
I love your time amen,Goodbye. Have a good night. I hope you feel better.
i really love your confidence that m oney has gone,"Oh, I'm so sorry. At least you won't ever fall for something like that again..."
My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous....,hi i am sorry to hear that what are they trying to shame you with? what are they trying to shame you with?
It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non-profit.,"well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation"
"I am not making much income with the COVID-19, either.",it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you
Two different (so-called) friends of mine need to get a life.,shame on them to do that to you well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing.
"Yeah, people don't know that just because my two friends go ""Way back,"" does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two (so-called) friends?",definatly not ...have you tried explaining your situation to them?
"No, they don't know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID-19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year.",well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?
I might be able to do that.,"unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that,"
"Well, I used to donate a LOT in year's past.",a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money.
Great point.,times and situations change so thats ok.
My friends may like to know that I am trading time....instead of donating money.,i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out
"Yes, you make a good point.",I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not
The proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight.,"Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality we don't know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect"
"I need to think of others ways to contribute that won't have my friends hating on me. I have pride, too.",BUt it should be what you want not what your 'freinds want. you should be proud of yourself.
Yeah......,Hopefully next year will bring better things and maybe even a better friend that does not judge into your life.
The problem is that I am not sure it my friends are going to believe me; I am a well-to-do individual We can only hope for a better 2021 Not sure how quickly the markets rebound....,"well if they do not believe you as well you might really need to rethink your friendships and the meaning in those so called freind ships. hopefully soon for all of us, but hold on to the thought of being healthy"
"Well, I usually go to their get-togethers. Both of my friends are well-to-do.",I am hoping you will find the right solution.
"Well, you have been helpful. Thank you. Good bye.",thanks I wish you all the luck and health good bye
Happy Holidays.,same you need to end the chat
I am so mad that I can't see straight.,Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that?
"Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me.",being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don't you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you?
Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him.,"I've been there too Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love?"
"Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings.","if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart"
"He told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? I think you're right.","i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter trust me, its not worth it in the long run maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you!"
"Noway! That is my worst nightmare, I am so sorry. That is a real eye opener for me/ That is exactly what I don't think I could handle. I just am in the worst cycle ever and don't have any friends to turn to or anybody who wants to listen to the drama. I think I have wasted a lot of my life and I can't ever get the time back that I have invested in him.","i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid. once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again, i bet there will be a LOT more breakups and a lot more options out there! all we can do is learn from our mistakes and not let the past repeat itself"
"Yeah, I can see your point. It is nice being able to vent to you and feel like I am being heard. I never got that in my relationship with him. I need to learn from the past this time and stop repeating it.","with your newly aquired free time, you can focus on you! start a new hobby, dye your hair,do something you always wanted to do!"
I haven't even had the time to get myself cute and fixed up in forever! I love that idea! I need to get my haircut.,know what the best part is?
"No, I have idea?","get yourself fixed up and cute, and find a hot new guy. your ex will see on social media and know he messed up and see you happy. its quite theraputic :D"
HAHA!! YES!! I was thinking the exact same thing! The best revenge is moving on and looking good and with somebody hot!,EXACTLY! You deserve so much better! Make yourself feel like it and everyone see it! :D :D
Sounds great! I am revived and am going to schedule a spa day and reinvent myself! Out with the old! Thank you for your encouragement today. I am going to move on from this mess and make my life better. Thanks again!,Good luck!
Hello,"Hi there, how are you doing today?"
I doing good.. how are you?,I am good thanks. What would you like to talk to me about?
I am going to school and this semester I am having too much pressure ... could not handle it.,I am sorry to hear that. Have you got anyone you can talk to? Maybe take some time off?
I cannot take any time off since this is in the middle of the semester. And dropp ing any class is not an option either.,So you feel that you are trapped and yet you are not coping properly?
I am having too much anxiety and don't know how to deal with it.,I suggest that you talk to a counsellor. There should be free services available at your university.
What kind of advise should I be seeking from the counsellor?,"Well, perhaps they can at least alleviate your anxiety somewhat. Or maybe even get you a sick note to give you a little extra time to complete your assignment.s"
Do you think that could hurt my grade if I turn them in late?,"No, as long as you have a doctor's letter explaining why."
"But I am not sick, would the counsellor write note for me under this situation?",There is more than one way to be sick. You sound as though you are suffering from depression and stress.
I guess you are right... I will try to make an appointment with the counselor next week.,Do you have any friends or family that you can discuss this with?
I have an elder sister I can talk to.,Is she sympathetic to what you are feelign?
I think so..,Well that is a good start. Maybe you could make a list of things you want to discuss with your counsellor too.
I like the idea .. thanks..,Try not to worry - I hope that things go well with you.
I hope so.. thank you for you suggestion.,All the best to you in your future and thank you for talking! You have to press quit first cos I can't :)
You have a good day...,and you :) Can you press quit and take the survey :)
hello,"Hello there, how can I help you?"
yes i had problems sleeping one night i was so angry that i couldnt sleep,I am sorry to hear that. How often do you have problems sleeping?
i have them frequently when my neighbors are loud with their music.,"I hear you, I used to have noisy neighbours too. How long have you been living next to your noisy neighbours for?"
Its hard because they dont answer there door so i can tell them about the issue.,"If noise levels are above the legal limit, you can get the police involved, however, its probably better to have that open conversation with them first. Let them have the opportunity to fix it before it escalates. Have you tried just a simple knock on the wall to let them know you are not happy? Since they are not answering the door."
Unfotunately the police won't do anything about it because they know these neighbors are trouble. i even tried to communicate with the neighbor one day getting my mail.,"I would personally try to write a letter and post it through their door, give them 24 hours to be able to read it and think about it. If they continue to be noisy the next day, you should definitely call the police. The police are there for law and order, and it sounds as though they are causing a public nuisance which is what the police are there to do, no matter how troublesome your neighbours are. They aren't above the law."
"i cannot write a letter because they will not understand since they dont speak english much, Again, the police don't wat to get involved, thank you for your input but i dont think i have anymore option but move and sell my house, I just think that getting away from them would help","I understand you feel helpless, but I really think that is the last option. I don't know if you are saying the police will not help because this is what you have been told by a friend or this is your experience. But they really are there to help you in a case like this."
i have contactd the police they told me its not a problem the can fix,"""Police typically are responsible for maintaining public order and safety, enforcing the law, and preventing, detecting, and investigating criminal activities. These functions are known as policing"""
apparently none of the household members will open the door for the police i will try again thank you for all your help i hope you have a great day.,"Then I would suggest if the police are not able to help you take the officers badge numbers and contact your local council or government, No problem. I know your issue will be solved without having a move away. Have a great day too!"
Hello. I am battling with my childhood trauma that i feel is affecting my everyday life with my child and spouse. I don't know how to tell my spouse about my childhood in fear he doesn't want to be with someone with a upbringing such as mine.,"Hi, thank you for chatting with me. From what I understand, you are struggling with childhood trauma and this is affecting everyday life with your child and spouse."
"Yes, correct. I am not sure how to tell my spouse about my childhood trauma. He wants to know. He wants to help me. But I am not sure where to begin with explaining it to him.","That is a really hard situation to be in, but I know that you can have that conversation with your spouse! Does he have any idea about any of the trauma you have experienced?"
I am worried it will effect his views on me. And he has a very rough idea of things that have happened.. he tells me he wants to know everything so he can help me move forward.. but when i try to talk about it i ramble and end up not explaining anything. I have even tried writing it down.. and nothing seems to work.,Just listening to you talk I can tell this is something that is making you extremely anxious.
very much so.. whenever it gets brought up i free and begin to ramble and i think it makes him overwhelmed ..,One thing I would suggest is after writing everything down that you rehearse it for a while in front of a mirror and picture that you are talking to your husband while you are doing this.
He had a very different childhood then myself. Almost complete opposite then myself. And I have tried... i cant seem to get my self to even put my past down on paper... When I have tried to i end up sending my self into a panic.,Have you reached out to other people or a group of people who may have experienced the same type of trauma you have?
No.. i do not know many people fro my area. As soon as i was able to leave where i grew up i packed up and left. We live in a extremely rural area where there is not many new faces.,I have also experienced childhood trauma in my past and it was extremely hard to get through. I found talking to people who went through the same thing helped a lot.
Maybe i will have to look int finding support group in my area...thank you very much!,"After speaking with others in the same situation, I was able to convey this to my loved ones in a better way and I was much more comfortable with it,"
thank you for your help!,You are very welcome! Thank you for chatting with me today!
You did a great job!,"I am glad I could help, if you ever need anything else don't be afraid to contact us back!"
Hi,hello
Hope you are doing well,"i'm good, what is troubling you this afternoon?"
I am not happy with my friends. They were trying to let me down,"if i get you clearly, you mean your friend disappointed you. how?"
Yes. There were a argument between two of my friend while trying to resolve the issue they all started targeting me.,i have a hard time with my friends too sometimes
Then what you do at that time,"i used to give them time to cool off, when they are back to their senses, they will contact me and apologize what causes the argument in the first place ?"
"I was trying to stop the fight, I just said bit loud , ""Stop all this nonsense at my place."" Then they all started backfiring me.","oh,jst give them time to reflect on what happen, they will definitely reach out to you, but you also have to make an effort to forgo the situation because they see you raising your voice on them as a sign of command of seniority."
I feel like not talking to them. Without any reason they made such a big mess I feel like they are not my true friends. you are right I should give them time to realize their mistakes,"exactly, that will also gives you the necessary time to know how to react to their forthcoming apologies"
Thanks for all your suggestions. I would try to implement on it.,"even if they haven't reach out, that doesn't mean they are not sorry just be patient with them"
Thanks! I would not going to talk to them have a wonderful New Year! Bye,"yes, give them time same to you friend"
"I am feeling very sad right now, my boyfriend just broke up with me out of the blue",I am so sorry that happened to you. It can be very difficult to cope with situations that seem they come out of nowhere. Did your boyfriend give you any reason for ending the relationship?
He said he has been struggling with depression and needed to be alone,Sometimes having depression can make a person feel that they need to seclude themselves. Were you aware that he felt this way?
He has been distant recently.,Unfortunately that can be a sign of depression or that something is going on. Have you been able to communicate with him previously about becoming distant?
Every time I would bring it up he would dismiss it. I just don't know what to do. How can I get him back?,Maybe you could try to talk to him about seeking help for depression? Talking to someone close to him or even a professional would help him immensely. Talking to a counselor would help him learn ways to cope with his feelings.
That is a good idea. I want him to get back to being himself. He is like a different person right now. It's scary.,"I understand completely. Depression runs in my family and if it goes untreated, can scare anyone that is involved. You can try suggesting that he talks to a close friend, family member, or counselor to talk about how he is feeling and ways to cope with it. Sometimes medication could be a good way to fix the chemical imbalance that can cause depression."
"I will try to help him, he just doesn't want to seem to talk to my anymore. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach it with him?","You could start a conversation by saying that you just want to check on him and see if he is okay and how he is doing. You don't want to start the conversation by immediately telling him to get help, as he might just get defensive."
That is a good approach. And you don't think I will further upset him?,"I don't believe it will upset him if you ease into suggesting that he should talk to someone he is close to or seeing a professional. Your main goal is to check on him and make sure that he is okay since he seems to want to be alone and not talk to anyone. Once he tells you how he is doing you could mention that even talking to someone about his thoughts and feelings could lift a weight off his shoulders. If he seems that he doesn't really know why he feels the way does, you could suggest that medically speaking, sometimes our brains don't produce the chemicals that we need them to and it could make us feel bad. Seeing a professional to get their opinion would also help greatly."
"I agree, I hope he is agreeable to all of this. I just miss him so much and want him back.",It's very hard to see someone we care about go through this. Communication is one of the best medicines there is to help someone feel better.
"I just hope he opens up to me, and if not me, someone who can help him.","Even just trying to talk to him to see how he is doing will show him that care about him. I'm sure that once he is talking to someone about his thoughts and feelings, he will start to get back to his old self."
Going to the store gives me Panic Attacks! Driving also makes me highly anxious. I am on medication but this only seems to help moderately.,Hello
Hi,"So just to ensure that I understand you correctly, you are feeling anxious about going to the store during the pandemic"
No. This has been going on before the pandemic COVID didn't cause my anxiety,"Okay, so just general anxiety about it then."
Yessir,How long have you had this anxiety issue?
"Only the past couple of years. It came on suddenly at a nail salon after I had an allergic reaction to a chemical in acrylic nails. Originally the doctors thought it was brain inflammation. What suggestions do you have for improving it? Meditation? Exercise? I do art. And never have anxiety when I'm painting, however, I cannot exactly do that at the store",Have you thought about looking for support groups with people who also have anxiety about being in public?
I have and I did,Have you thought about brining a friend with you to the store? Someone you are comfortable with? Having someone you are comfortable with may help to calm the anxiety while you are out.
"Support groups don't really help stop the Panic Attacks. They cause all sorts of sensations. Fast heart rate, chills, shakes, My brain feels foggy and impersonal. I do go to the store often with my fiance :) That has helped a lot","I have also had anxiety in the past when in public places, so I know how it feels to be anxious while out."
"Yeah, it's definitely annoying. But it isn't JUST at the store. I was diagnosed with Panic Attack Disorder and even have attacks at home where I freak out. It's been better since I was on medication but I never feel completely....normal",Another thing that may help is having some headphones in attached to your phone or an MP3 player so you can have some calming music or something in your ear while you are out.
That's actually a really good idea. Distractions definitely seem to be the way to go for me. That's probably why art helps so much,I found that distractions were great for me too!
"I wonder if it should be calming music or music that I generally feel like dancing too I know that sometimes calming music kinda makes me more centered and aware of myself which can exacerbate the problems sometimes. I usually listen to music loudly when Im in my car to help with the anxiety Of course, I always think its working then I get to the store and my hands hurt from gripping my steering wheel so hard XD",Whatever music you think would be best would be a good idea.
I think a lot of my anxiety doesnt stem from social stuff but from a fear of death tbh What other distractions can you reccomend? *recommend,Do you have a stress ball or something you can keep with you in your pocket while out?
I don't!,I think picking up one of those and having it with you might also help!
That's a really good idea too. Thanks so much,You're very welcome!
<3 Have a good one!,"Thank you, you too!"
"Hello, I would like to talk to you about my academic pressures I hope you may be able to help",Yes here to listen and to help you in anyway I can
"I guess the problem is that I am faced with impending deadlines with my studies, and that I am not that great with my organization or time management, and compounded with distractions. Thank you So I don't know if you have any tips or personal experiences on how to deal with such issues",By any chance have you thought about trying out some time management class?
"No, because time management I feel is something that I have to resolve on my own, and I have enough courses on my plate right now. But I guess for time management, I tend to be distracted easily or spend too long on other stuff outside of my studies","Oh ok I see. I have actually been in this type of situation before, and I took those classes and they actually helped."
I see. So would you be able to share some tips on time management?,Yes sure I can .
"like specifically, I don't know. I am just going with my instincts and my instincts aren't great or mature",Find out where your wasting you time? Try creating time management goals? Implement a Time management Plan
"well I guess I can put out like a time table on what I should get through in the day, etc. setting alarm clocks on set times, etc.",Yes thats a great idea. You could also reward yourself when you have done a good job
"But also, with the ongoing pandemic, it doesn't help either. For example, I am trapped at home and it feels claustrophobic but it's not safe to go out either. And my mind wanders in such circumstances too. yes that's good advice. I have done it but sometimes I overdo my rewards like take too long of a break, etc. so in my opinion, I need moderation and maturity.",I can relate to that as well. This pandemic has gotten everyone down.
for sure. It's really really distracting and has made my life and mind wander aimlessly. I was a lot more productive with my life and studies before March or so,Dont be so down on yourself you are mature. Just need a little help managing some things.
"Yeah true. On that point, I know I have done well before, and I know I can pass, but I don't like the direction I am going in and these new trends. so I feel disappointed and guilty because I know I am better than this and ought to be.",If you do some of those suggestions I believe you will be just fine.
"yes for sure, your advice will be fresh in my mind after our chat. I have a renewed need to attend to my studies so I do feel that.",Oh also do you like music?
"just have to be more hardworking and contentious, basically. yeah I do. I try not to put music on while I study but I do that sometimes when I am doing other forms of assignments. So I have my rules on those.",While your studying play some soft music in the background that you like and see if that helps.
"yeah I will, from time to time. I think I am good to go from this point. Thank you so much for your helpful input.",Your so welcome and Thank you for allowing me yo help
"Hello, I hope you can help.",Hi there! How can I help you today?
"I am depressed and have zero motivation, especially at work.",I hear you. Is there a particular reason why you might feel this way?
I don't know. I just don't have any energy. Life just has too many problems. It is too much weight to carry.,Is it that your life is just getting so stressful and busy that work feels like the last straw? Correct me if I'm wrong.
"I guess work itself isn't the problem. My job is a little boring, but not that bad. I think everything else in life is just too much. And it leaves me with no energy for anything else, like work.","Ah, I understand that feeling completely. It's totally normal given the current situation and even without the whole virus situation, life is just tough. Do you work in the mornings?"
"Yes, the virus doesn't help. And my parents have health problems which is scary. I start work in the morning. I work a normal 8 hour day, sometimes 9 or 10 hours.",Just from hearing that I can imagine your stress and how hard it must be to get through a single day. Do you think it would be possible to get a day off or change your hours a bit?
"Yes, it can be quite hard. Very exhausting. Yes, I do have time off. I plan on taking 3 days off at the end of the month. For a small getaway.","Ah, that could be exactly what you need! I suggest you take that time to completely detox and get away from work and your problems"
"Yes, I think that will help. And time spent reading. What do you suggest until then?","Until then, I suggest you prepare a little bit for the trip each day. Give yourself something to look forward to"
"Yes, that does help me feel good. I wonder if morning exercise might help?","For example, packing a bit of clothes each night or planning which places you'll visit Yes! Morning exercise will definitely help eliminate stress and make you feel better about your health and more comfortable Take it slow and don't forget to breathe :)"
"Yes, that sounds nice. Breathing is great! I have been doing breathing meditation, which helps. THank you for the support.",No problem! Is there anything else I can help with today?
"No, I think that is all! Thank you for everything!",Have a great day and no problem!
You too!,"I will, thanks"
"Hi, how are you?",I'm doing well. How are things going with you?
I'm really pissed off. My friend totally screwed me over. We were doing a business deal and he lied about how much money we got from the deal. He screwed me!,"Oh no, that must be so frustrating for you."
We made a piece of software together. It was sweet. We were marketing it to different firms. We thought we could make a bundle.,So you were partners in the development of the software and both put in a lot of work? Did you have any indication that he might try to defraud you?
The stupid SOB went behind my back and cut a deal. I didn't get as much as I should have. I totally didn't suspect anything because we had been friends for so long. I guess the money was too sweet. Never again...,"So it feels like he took advantage of your friendship. That must be hard, but don't beat yourself up about it. Let's come up with some safeguards for the future to avoid more incidents."
"Good point. I feel like a fool, but it could happen to anyone. Safeguards. Ok.","What do you think you might have done differently? You can only control your behavior, not the other guy's. Could you have put a contract in place? Or have a shared Google drive where you both put all the information relevant to the development and marketing? You doing okay? It was nice talking with you, and I do hope I helped you feel more in control of your next business venture. It's okay to feel that anger at your (former) friend, too. Use that feeling to work through things and I'm sure you'll be feeling more optimistic soon."
"Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.",sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?
"Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.",It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.
"I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat. Nothing too serious so far.",I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.
"I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.","I can understand staying alone will be devastating. Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family."
Thanks for the advice. We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone. That helps.,I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow.
"That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine. Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.",Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.
"I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.",We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.
"I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!",Think other way. You defeat it and you won.
I hope so. I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.,You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.
Thanks for the encouragement. 10 days cannot come fast enough.,I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.
"Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.",Thank you! It was nice talking to you too.
hello,"Hello, how are you today?"
i am ok so far,What brings you here today?
i am depressed and need some inspiration,Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression?
Covid-19 and money issues,"Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally?"
my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough,I can understand how hard that must have been. I'm glad they are doing ok now though!
yeah me too,How have you been using your time during the crisis?
yeah mostly working and meditation,That's great! Meditation is also something I've picked up during this time. It's really helpful and can keep you balanced. Do you have a routine or do you just do it sporadically?
i mostly do it sporadically but i do need to do it more often,"It's great to try to integrate it into your day. All of us tend to have at least a few moments each day to ourselves. Even if it's during a shower or bathroom break, you really can meditate anywhere! It's all about being in the here and now."
so true,"When things get stressful, meditation can be difficult. Sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard. One thing I've learned to be helpful when I'm stressed is to breathe in through my nose while internally counting to three and out through my mouth counting to three. The counting tends to distract my mind from whatever stressful thing I was thinking of before."
i like that thank you for the tip i must use that more often,You're welcome! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
no that will be thanx for listening to me,"My pleasure! I hope things start to look up for you. This has been a difficult time for all of us, but we'll pull through together! Nice speaking with you. Have a great day!"
Hello,Good afternoon! What can I help you with today?
I've been feeling a lot of pressure and stress lately due to school,"Oof, yes, school can be a tough situation. Are you close to the end of the semester? That can be both a relief and stressful, because a break is near, but all the exams and projects are due."
"Yes, I am a little more than halfway done with the semester The thing is that I am in a doctoral program, so even though the semester is close to the end, I always need to continue working","Ahh, I see. That is a great deal of time and work. What are you studying?"
It is... I am in psychology I have to work on my thesis on the side even with all of my classes and I have a hard time managing my time and keeping track,"Time management can be very difficult with a normal class load, that sounds exhausting."
It is!,"Do calendars help you at all? I am a super visual person, so calendars and planners are invaluable to me, as well as different colors of ink and labels so I can visually divide my attention Getting a million different colors of pens and highlighters changed my organization for the better."
"I do keep a physical and electronic agenda, but I feel like even if I write down my tasks, I find a way to procrastinate which is what I am having trouble with","Also, setting clear boundaries for your study/work and relax times may help. I like to set a timer for, say, 45 minutes, and work/write/read/study for that long, then, I get a 10 minute break. I'll go outside, refresh my coffee, grab a snack, dance to some music, stretch, then set another timer for 45 minutes, then another break for 10 minutes. That allows my brain to take a second and refresh from the work."
"That is actually very helpful, I'll take note of it I think it would help to fix break times so I can actually focus on working","Or, like, today, I woke up and spent half an hour allowing myself to drink my coffee and scroll through Reddit. Then it was time to work on my group project for 45 minutes, then a break, then I worked again, took a break, went to a class, etc. Scheduling your breaks can be helpful too so your lizard brain doesn't freak out and go ""WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING FOREVERRRR"""
"I agree!!! That really is helpful, thank you","which, for me at least, is where the fatigue sets in. You're very welcome! I hope I was helpful. You seem positive and willing to try new things, and I think you will be successful even if you are tired."
The pandemic hasn't really helped either I'm always locked in my apartment and staying sitting down in front of my computer all day,Definitely not. Everyone's Maslow hierarchy getting knocked out from under them is extremely disconcerting.
"Hahaha, Maslow, i like it.","Like how is a person supposed to study, self-actualize, when we literally don't know what will happen next?"
"I agree! I've also been turning to drugs a lot lately due to the situation. Procrastinating makes me feel guilty, and I end my day too early to smoke and focus my mind on something other than studying....","Are there aspects of your study that you dislike, or are you just ready to be done with school? Little of column A + column b?"
"Hm, I think it has less to do with liking or disliking, and more with starting a very hard and lengthy degree online without any social contact","Ah, yes, that makes sense. And working from home is infamously hard, again, for lack of boundaries, so in addition to just not seeing people and getting the casual affirmation and confirmation messages on a daily basis of like ""hey Jim you did a great job on that spreadsheet"" or ""Haha Jessica you're so funny"", we also are writing papers in our pajamas and bedclothes, which makes it seem interminable."
Ugh exactly,"Listening to lectures while the doorbell is ringing and it's just so strange and we aren't set up to do it. That's why I'm a big fan of specific spaces in my house since March. I tried to sit in bed with my laptop and do things but 1. I'm old and it hurts my wrists and 2. my headspace is so completely different from being my computer chair and at my desk. I try to be really strict about where I do my work., maybe trying to structure that a bit could help you feel a little more in control of the work load and your day's schedule."
"I agree, that makes a lot of sense! Thank you You have been a big help today and I really feel listened and understood. I really appreciate it","I am very glad to hear that! You sound motivated to succeed and I think that you deserve to take care of yourself and stay healthy to complete your studies. It will be hard but it will also be worth it, and you should be proud. Good luck with everything!"
"Wow, thank you! Have a great day",Thank you! You too!
Hey.,"Hello, what's on your mind today?"
Just wondering what I can do to deal with my cocky annoying friend Rick and his new car (as above),How long have you been friends?
30+ years since high school,And he has always had cocky attitude? Have you ever told him that?
"He has, and yes I've told him, he just dismisses it, thinks it's funny that I get jealous","I understand your frustration, it's upsetting when they dismiss what you say even though you have been friends for so long."
Thanks.,"What I would recommend in this case is, spend more time with other friends who appreciate you. You also need to tell Rick your honest thought, don't beat around the bush but let him know you're serious"
That's good advice! Thanks. I wonder how I can get through to him to really let him know I'm serious. Ideas?,"I have been in the same situation myself, what I usually do is sit down with them and start the conversation in a serious mood. Explain everything I need to say and tell them that I mean every word. If they don't seem to accept and change, I keep my distance from them"
Makes sense. Unfortunately we live on the same street so it's kind of hard not to run into each other. :/,"That's even easier to make it clear, if you run into him, just give him a polite greetings. The point is, make it clear you have had enough"
"Right, so basically let him know if he continues to act like he does, we're done as friends, correct? Or should I not be that bold?","Yes. Be not too harsh at first. I would say to give him 1 more chance. If he still doesn't respect your words, it's the best for both to say it clearly."
"Sounds good, I'm looking forward to getting this resolved. Now I just have to work on the wording (what I'll say) to come across as serious without being too harsh, I guess. Suggestions welcome! :)",You have the right mindset! Practice before talking will help you deliver your thoughts better.
Yeah I tend to get too emotional lol,"I would start with something along the line ""Look, I know we have had this conversation many times. However, i feel as though you never take me seriously. I want to say this one last time...."""
That's perfect. Copying that down right now! Seriously!,"Getting emotional is totally fine, that's why you need practice"
True it's just we've been friends for so long it would suck if we weren't anymore. So I've got a plan and know what to do. You've been super helpful! Thanks!,"I understand, it's difficult to come to this decision when you've been friends for so long. I hope he appreciates your friendship just as you do and tries his best."
We will see!,You're very welcome. is there anything I can do for you?
"No, I think that's it! Much appreciated!",I think you can end our session here. I'm glad I could help a bit
I am very upset,"Hello, how are you doing today? Im sorry to hear your upset. Do you want to go into why you are?"
A friend of more than 20 years hurt me deeply by judging me for not buying a gift for my nephew for his birthday.,Why would they judge you on that? Do they know your nephew as well?
"Yes, she is very close friends with my nephew's mother as well. She is the kind of person who will go into deep debt and overdraw her bank account to buy someone a gift, I am not. I could not afford the gift, I am disabled and on a very minimal income.","That i can relate too, i am also disabled and on SSI. Have you spoken to her about how she upset you?"
I did. I took a few days to cool off and then told her that her comments hurt me. I know that she's aware of my financial situation as well as the fact that I am disabled. Her response was that she said nothing wrong.,Thats a tough spot to be in with a friendship that has lasted so long. Does she tend to treat you like this regularly?
"No, she really never has. Typically, she feels like other people walk all over her and take advantage of her, but that's never been me and its never been our relationship.",Then would you say its a little odd for her to be acting in this manner towards you?
"Yes, quite. At times over the years she can become quite self absorbed. But she's never been so downright hurtful. I can't really see a way for our relationship to be the same anymore.",I would agree that the relationship is getting a bit toxic but before terminating such a long relationship i would do one thing. I would try to see if there is something going on in her life right now for her to be acting like this. Sometimes people dont know how to talk about something thats bothering then and it in turn comes out as anger or spite.
"That's true. We've been through a lot together over the years. But I can't deny that what she said hurt, and our conversations are just so superficial now.",Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship. I would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.
Hi,hello!! how is your day?
So this lockdown is making me depressed. I'm doing ok today What should I do?,what is the reason for depression are you feeling bored or some other reasons?
I have a cold and I am bored too TRying to keep busy trying sorry for the caps,"no problem, I am also facing the same problem of being bored during the lockdown"

Hi and good afternoon Thank you for your time,"Hello, and good afternoon yourself. How are you?"
Doing pretty good. Struggling a little,What is making you struggle?
"My situation involves our Daughter and Son-in-Law. He is not treating her well, rude, gaslighting and treating the dog better. He is also not very nice to our grandaughter This is confidential, Right?","Yes, of course it is :). So we are talking about your daughter and her husband and their child together, right?"
"Yes, He is a nice guy to others. At home he is so different.","I understand, people can often show different sides depending on who is around. Do you have any reason to think your daughter or granddaughter are in physical danger?"
"No, they are safe. He's, like I said, a nice guy. Our Daughter, we are very close and she would tell us.",That's great news! It sounds as though you are just concerned about how she is sometimes being treat. Have you had any conversation with your daughter about their relationship?
"Yes, numerous. Like I said we are close to our daughter. She wants to stay together and talks with him. He stays for whatever reason. I wish he would talk to me, to us. We have offered. He knows that we care about him.","And that is so important and good to know there is trust from his side, to me it sounds as though that could be an olive branch for you to try and establish a conversation with both of them. An open and positive communication is always the first step in resolving anything."
We have tried this before when we visit and he appears receptive. Treats he well and then when we are gone. He falls back into he behaviour.,"I recently went though a similar exercise with a friend and her boyfriend. We sat down in a room and spoke about our feelings. We had ground rules first and everyone knew they could talk without being judged or escalating. Maybe you could suggest follow up conversations, re-cap about what was spoken about previously and they can both evaluate how they have progressed since then?"
Thats sounds like a good idea. We have talked with them individually. Now the next step. We shall see. Yeah consistency leads to accountability. I like the idea. Thank you.,I believe you have both their interests in mind. You sound like a positive person and you are just concerned for all 3 people involved.
"For sure, she is our daughter and our granddaughter needs her daddy.",I hope they will be well receptive of your suggestion for a follow up.
Thank you. I have some good ideas after chatting with you.,"No worries, I'm grateful for your time as well. If there is nothing else, I hope it all goes well and you have a wonderful weekend :)"
Good morning,"Hello, good morning! How are you today?"
Not too bad just wanted to talk with you about my alcohol addiction if you don't mind.,I would be happy to listen and help if I can :) When did you notice you had a problem with alcohol?
The thing is I am drinking beer almost every day since I started to work from home. And with weather so nice in upcoming weeks I can't see myself stop drinking.,How many beer a day do you typically drink?
At least 4 pints. A lot of money goes on drinks as well.,"I see. So if I understand correctly, you are concerned because you are drinking more than you used to, more frequently, and you are afraid you cannot stop? And it's affecting you financially?"
"Yes, that's right. And I know I should stop but I just got addicted.",It's really great that you have the insight to see that it may be a problem...that awareness is the most important first step!
Thank you for understanding,"I haven't experienced addictions but I have been supporting my daughter with her addiction for many years, and I have seen how challenging it's been for her. She has found AA very helpful, and gets a lot of support from her peers there. Have you tried going to an AA meeting?"
I think I am not quite confident in going somewhere in person. I don't want other people to see my addiction problem,"The thing about AA is everyone in the room will be understanding and nonjudgemental and supportive. And you can learn from them what has worked for them. And it's okay to sit quietly and just listen, you are not forced to participate actively. And...it's anonymous! They have a code, outside meetings nobody is to disclose that you were there."
To be fair I am scared also to go such places. If somebody from work will see me I would get in real trouble as I am working from home and drinking.,"I can understand that being scary, keeping your job is essential. Whereabouts are you? (I'm in CAnada)"
I am in UK. Maybe you know some online courses you are aware of?,"Oh!! I just remembered. My daughter goes to meetings virtually because of the pandemic. I am pretty sure there would also be virtual AA meetings in the UK, via Zoom"
Oh that's great I will try then. Do you know if there are any fees?,"Hmm I am afraid I don't, have you tried a google search? That's a great idea, to find an online program of some sort, if AA does not appeal to you. And no, there are no fees, AA is completely free. And, you can get a sponsor, do you know about that?"
What do you mean by a sponsor?,"My daughter has a sponsor, it's an important part of AA (and optional). Her sponsor has been clean for over 20 years. She is there to support my daughter, and help her work her way through learning the 12 steps. Beacuse she's been through it, her sponsor is very understanding and supportive."
"Alright, Don't know if I need one yet. Will see eventually how it goes in AA.","I wish you all the best in your journey. You are doing all the right things in both recognizing that you have a problem, and seeking information on ways to deal with it. I admire your insight."
Thank you very much for you help. Now I know what I have to do. All the best to you.,"You are welcome, it was a pleasure speaking with you. All the best! You can do it :)"
"Thank you, bye :)",Bye :)
I need some tips to overcome from that problem,Hey. How can I help?
Give me some tips to get succeed in my life,Okay. Well lets start with exactly what the problem is. What kind of tips do you need?
I was totally upset due to my financial career,Okay I understand. Tell me a little about that.
I had a lot of debts,That is unfortunate. How did you accumulate such debt?
Because of this covid situation,That's tough. It has personally affect me as well as my financial health as well. I know the frustration.
So please tell me some advice,Well to do so I need a little more information. Have you already taken any steps to help your situation? If so what steps have you taken?
yes I arranged a loan in a bank,Okay that is an excellent start. Now to avoid another debt later on. Do you have a job to work with the payments to pay back the loan?
yes I works in a broad wide company. So I will manage,If I may offer a suggestion. Have you thought of contacting a debt relief program? In some cases they can substantially reduce debt to something much more manageable.
I am worried about being perfect on my job. I don't want to lose my job.,I hear you are trying to be perfect on your job because you are worried about losing your job. How long have you been at your job?
"I have been working for about 4 months, but I just am not as fast at it as everyone else. I'm trying so hard working late and everything but it's never enough.",That can be hard when you are working so hard to try to do your best. Can you consult with a supervisor or co-workers to get some help?
"Maybe I could ask my friend and co-worker for some tips. I'm a little embarrassed to do so, but don't know where to turn. I don't want to get fired.",Asking for help isn't always a bad thing. I asked for help at my last job and they gave me someone to help out. I was so relieved.
That's true maybe it could turn out for the better. But what if they see me as incompetant?,"I can see that you have worry of being seen incompetent but as long as you are doing your best, they have to see the efforts you are making as positive."
That's a good way to put it.,Sometimes deep breaths can help keep you calm when approaching others in an anxiety provoking situation.
I will have to try that. That might help.,Have you thought of doing additional work related trainings? Sometimes they can give suggestions to improve work abilities.
That sounds great. Do you think my work would be supportive?,Work can often pay for trainings or offer suggestions what may improve work strategies.
"Wow, I hope I can take advantage of that. I will have to check into that. Who should I approach at work?",You could ask your immediate supervisor or sometimes Human resources for support.
I can do that. I think I'll reach out tomorrow to Human Resources for some help.,That sounds like a good plan to reach out for support. Is there anything else I can help with?
No that should be all. I am feeling more confident in strategies to use to help me. Thanks,You are very welcome.
Hello! Anyone there?,hello! it's nice to meet you
Thank you you too,What would you like to talk about today?
How I can feel less ashamed My house is so disorganized I won’t let anyone co e over,What is making you feel ashamed?
Every single room is disarrayed,it seems that you feel ashamed because you are feeling messy? is this correct?
Yes,When did this begin?
Sorry It started about ten years ago I had emergency restroom call I have moved into this house almost ten years ago At first it was great everything was fine since it was new house but after we got settled it went down hill from that,What do you feel like brought you into this situation?
hi,Hi! How are you today?
am good ..what about you?,I'm doing well. How can I help you today?
a break up with my partner please read up,I'm so sorry. I went through a bad break up last year. Can you tell me what happened? Are you there?
yes i am ahere i and this lady dated for 2weeks suddenly she said she doesn't love me anymore imagine that,"I'm sorry, I'm sure that has made you feel rejected."
very well,"I'm sure it is hard to express how you feel with it being a short relationship, people may not understand. But sometimes we can feel such a strong connection and have faith in people very fast."
its very hard i loved the girl with all my heart,I understand feeling connected to someone you've only known for a short amount of time. I'm sure you feel like you wont be able to let your guard down again anytime soon.
yes i have faith in people very fast seriously its like your seeing my mind,"Maybe this could be a learning experience? I always try to see the best in people, but have learned to let people earn my trust. Not just get it for free."
yeah,Is there anything positive in your life that you can try to focus your attention on?
i heard is better to let a girl love you thank for you loving her yes my ACHEIVEMENT IN LIFE AND WORK,Do you enjoy your job? What are some of your achievements?
Hello,Hey! How are you?
"I am hanging in there, how are you doing?",Im doing good :) How you doing hanging in there?
"Well, I have been dealing with insomnia, and that is pretty much ruining my day lately.",Im sorry to hear that. Have you tried to help it or see a doctor?
"Yes, I have. I tried some natural things at first, but it did not work. Then I went to the doctor, and guess what? He said I am having insomnia due to anxiety.",Do you feel anxious though? maybe the doctor is right and maybe loosing stress is the answer :)
"I think so, I am worried about my future with the pandemic, I guess we all are. I am from Brazil and lots of people are dying there. I have lost 2 relatives to COVID in Brazil and also lost 4 friends there",Yeah the pandemic hit badly there. I am sorry for your loss. Perhaps you just dont want to follow in the same pathway which is why you are stressed
"exactly. I am also very stressed because I have too much on my plate with school, working full time, kids at home distance learning",Yh thats seems like quite a lot and I know how you feel because of when I was a student. If i made it through you can too! try your best
"Thank you. The doctor prescribed an antidepressant that should help with anxiety and a sleeping pill, but I dont want to take it",If you dont take it you might never feel better. I would advice you to take it and see how you feel after
I am worried about getting addicted to it or something. Have you ever tried these type of meds /,"Yeah i have taken antidepressant when I had my son as I always needed to provide, and I can say it did help me get better"
"Hello, how are you doing today?",Im okay how are you?
"I am glad you are doing okay, I am struggling with my current employer which has brought me an area of anger and sadness.","Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel there. I can definately relate to that...What's going on?"
"My employer is great, I work for a local hospital as a house keeper technician, but my department is poorly observed by HR and corporate. I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months. I have already worked in this position for 7 months.",So you applied for the Security Team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company?
"Correct, when I took the position my manager said that I could transfer after six months. I felt lied to and the micromanaging and high turn overstaff due to my supervisor has me on that same boat now. I feel like my only option is to quit. HR was the one who delivered the transfer denial.","Wow, that is crazy that is going on, it doesn't seem fair at all... Have you tried going to any higher up? Perhaps in the HR department?"
"I am thoroughly disappointed, I have applied for a few local security job sites in my area that have had some interest in my resume. I figure I will leave the hospital since I was lied and I can only see this being the trend with this department. They keep their good workers and let the low skilled workers transfer out or they just quit.","That's horrible they would treat the HOSPITAL workers like this, with everything that is going on in the world today."
I have a six page paper of grievances for HR and a full unscripted transparent experience as an employer with details and dates of these frustrations. I know it will not go anywhere since their policy states that an employee must work six months from when they take a new position within the company. I went from a housekeep to a housekeeper technician (scrub walls and take curtains down and clean contact rooms).,That is a position right there in the line of fire. Have you tried for employment anywhere else? I wouldn't just quit and not have something else at least working in the background.
"I am paid $10.75 an hour and their security team makes about $12.50 plus overtime opportunities and details. I went to school for criminal justice and the hospital would have helped me obtain my bachelors if I worked for them after completing it, I had to work there for a year in order to get their help. I was looking forward to this opportunity, but now I am just to bitter to work there at this point. I loved what we stand for value wise, but their values are not walked out I have an interview soon with another company that I am just waiting on the details for, I think this will yield more fruit once I get the approval. I am uncertain if I will give two weeks if I can do a ""start today"" option.",I definitely understand that. Do you want a couple links on dealing with some stress? I personally like to run..
"Sure links are always helpful (for the record, I left the employer and work for fabulous healthcare company now that I have been with for two years). Do you run during the winter when it is cold, or do you have different coping strategies for the winter time. It is 8 degrees where I am at.",I live in Georgia so yes i so run every morning...Great stress reliever Wow that is cold.. I could not run in that what so ever... Do you have a gym?
Hello.,hello. how was your day?
Not very good. I just learned today that my job will be making layoffs.,"that's sounds good, you are learning about your job"
"No, that isn't good. People will lose their jobs. Po ssibly me.",don't worry my friend believe on your progress and hardwork and the luck too may be yours
I don't have seniority in my position. I have only been at my job for 5 years.,i could understand your state right now. its hard to be in this position of fear
"Yes, the uncertainty is crippling. Especially in these times.","yes, you are right especially during this pandemic many people face these kind of difficulties"
I'm not sure what to do and I just want to know what my company plans to do.,Always hope for a best result. This will keep you optimistic
I am definitely trying to stay optimistic and hopeful.,That' sounds too good .At the same time be ready to face whatever the life gives us
I agree. I am keeping my options open in case there are layoffs.,Life is full of surprises and miracles. and the same time life is full of pains and sorrow. it matters how we see even the layoff thing you can take it either as a surprise or pain
Well being laid off could be painful because I really like my job and it will be hard to find similar pay.,i have also faced the same problem before two years but the luck was on my side at that time and not last for long after some months i was asked to leave but now i become normal
Well that's good. I am hoping for the best for myself and my collegues. colleagues,that's good. you seems to be more optimistic and acceptable in nature and your concern about your colleagues is great
Hello. Thank you for listening to my disunion. situation,you are so welcome. How are you
i am okay but i am stressed about this,What is stressing you out. Can you help me understand?
i got a low pass grade in my college geology class this semester and worry about how this will affect my law school application when i apply,That is upsetting and stressful. I know you are rightfully concerned Can you talk to your geology professor for extra credit?
yes i am. do you think it will be ok and what should i do i can’t because the semester is over the and the grades are final. i reached out before about that but she said no,I think it is a REAL Concern and you really need to pull that grade up. It is a very tight race out there and even 1% grade point can make or break you If I were you I would than focus on pulling up all your grades to help avearage out geology course. Maybe contact the lawyer school or someone to do with that area to see what you can do to have a better chance.
thank you i appreciate it. i have a fairly high gpa still i have a 3.7 out of 4 but this looks so bad on my transcript lol,I know its hard but since this is over and in the past you can't cry over spilt milk so to speak. You can do this!
"that is a very good idea. i’m just not sure what law school yet bc i’m going to apply to a lot , i’m a sophomore so it’s somewhat far away but not that far away",Is there a way you can retake the geology class over?
thank u sm!! u rock ya i can but i don’t need to bc it’s unrelated to my majors,I have an even better idea actually two... One talk to your college counselor if they offer that to see a plan of action so to speak and two
also how’s ur life do u have any stress i can help u talk over true i will schedule a meeting with my counselor,Pray to God some people say prayers is all that is left to do when God should be your first person to run to I appreciate that but that would take several hours and I am here to help you.
true God is good,yes he is and even thru this pandemic Covid He is on the Throne and has a purpose
how’s the pandemic treating u,Trying to take it one day at a time and trying make lemonade out of lemons
i feel that it’s miserable but we have to make due just praying i dont get it,Its really hard but we are learning to live in the new normal life as it is and honestly worst is yet to come . We are not to know the future or why God choose it we just have to have hope and believe
"it’s been 15 min, it was great talking to u today thank u for giving me a plan of action it made me feel much better i agree. u have a blessed day",your welcome and it shows 14minu but take care and Keep the faith. I m glad I could help you
oops i was looking at the accept HIT timer instead ur right also what’s the bonus for this i forgot lol sorry,lol and i don't think u are supposed to say that in the chat . just for future ones. And since its xmas I have a secret.. you can google turk guru. its chrome extension and really helps and support person needs to close out the talk
Hello,Hello how are you?
Not so good. How are you doing?,I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong?
Yes. Well today I had a delivery order. So I went to McDonald's and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order.,"I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it."
"Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that's not true at all, I gave him the food So now i don't know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job","Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation?"
Of course I did. He told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. Im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad,"I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?"
Yes. But stuff like that makes me look bad and makes people dont trust me Sure. That can help. I would appreciate it,"Maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof. or maybe you can have a copy of the receipt and have the customer sign it as well."
Well. I normally take pictures of every delivery I make but I let this pass and look what happened,"it's okay, it happens to everyone. we are human and we tend to make the smallest mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them. Is there anything else bothering you at work?"
Yes. It won't happen again for sure. This makes me dont trust people again Well. This is the first time I ever faced this kind of problem at work,"as long as you believe in yourself to be honest, don't worry about what other people think. Your boss will come to understand you are a honest worker. It is also amazing that you have come such a long way without having other problems. that is great!"
I know but sometimes one small thing can hurt you and ruined the reputation that you had build for a long time,"Yes, i understand what you are saying. It's really hard to move on from bad experiences, staying positive is important in these situations."
Yes. I guess so. You are right. I just going to move on and do my things Thank you very much for taking your time and encouraging me with your words,There's no need to thank me! i hope I could make you feel better.
Yes you did. God bless you and have a good one,"Yes, you too! have an amazing rest of your day!"
hello is anyone there,"hello there, how are you doing?"
sad. i broke up with my girlfriend i do not know what to do,Ah I am sorry to hear that. I have not been in a relationship before but definitely understand the pain of loss
yes it is very difficult. we were together for 3 years i had to break up with her though,"That's unfortunate to hear, creating a bond with someone that long can be very hard to walk away from did you go your separate ways on good terms?"
yes you are right. it pained me to do it but it was for the best. no it ended roughly. she ran over my dog and i was angered i broke up but maybe i acted quickly and should ask for her back,Was it an honest mistake that she made?
yes i think so. she was rushing out to get cake for a party and was not looking.,How long have you had the dog for? Did you have the dog before the relationship started?
my dog was 13 years old. she was very close to me. i had her when she was a puppy,The dog then lived a very happy and fulfilling life from what I can tell. Dogs are among the best companions to ask for.
hi,hello
how are you?,"I am good , how is your side, how may be of help"
Fine thank you I have problem with my friend.,"okay, life is full of problems and challenges. Can you please tell me more about it. hello"
"He is such a negative character, he has shared my sensitive secrets with my girls friend, so that , she became upset, she didn't talk with me. I don't want to see his face, his name is Thomas.",that is very bad of him
very true Now my love relation has in very bad condition. what can I do now.?,"Just from our conversations, I can see how hateful you are to that your friend behaviour"
yes,I was in that kind situation when my rusted friend fucked up
So I already broke up my friendship with him,"the major concern now is your girl friend, you need to try to let her trust you back. As much she loves you, she will forgive you plead her, let her know how bad your friend is."
"yes sure, but how?",confess the fact to your girlfriend and feel remorseful
ok I will try my best.,distance yourself totally from bad company that cannot keep secret
I hope she will understand yeah,"Fidelity is most important in any relationship, open up to your girlfriend and if she refuse to forgive you, try to tell someone you know can talk to her."
yes I didn't want to see his face,"Fidelity is most important in any relationship, open up to your girlfriend and if she refuse to forgive you, try to tell someone you know can talk to her. PLS END THE CHAT"
"yes sure, Thank you for your kind words","THANKS, BYE PLS END THE CHAT"
Hello?,Hi
I could use some help. I'm not feeling so well.,What can I help you with tonight>
My girlfriend broke up with me and I think I'm suffering from depression now. Everything feels like a chore and I'm sad all of the time.,"From what you are telling me, you are very upset about your girlfriend breaking up with you and you don't feel motivated to do anything, is that right?"
Yeah,I can tell how anxious and upset that is making you feel.
I feel like a heavy weight is on me all the time. I'm not enjoying things I used to in the past.,"I can definitely understand that feeling as I had an ex who cheated on me and had a child with another man, so I know how hard that is."
How did you start to feel better?,I focused a lot on myself and making more time to do some of the hobbies that I didn't get a chance to do when we were together.
I wouldn't even know where to begin. I don't want to do anything right now.,"I know things are really hard right now, but I know you will make it through this!"
"Thanks, I appreciate it. What do you suggest I should do to begin with?",Have you talked to her since she broke up with you? Sometimes it helps to talk with your ex so you can get closure on the situation.
No I haven't talked to her. I think that would only make me feel worse right now.,"I understand that, have you tried to talk to a friend or family member who has gone through the same thing?"
"No, I haven't yet but that is a good idea.",Doing that definitely helped me too!
I was thinking about going to a gym.,I think that would definitely help too!
I want to start dating in the future but I am afraid.,"I felt the same way for a while after my breakup as well, but after I took my time it was good to get back into the dating game."
I appreciate the help.,"No problem! I am glad I was able to help you tonight,"
Hello my situation is that I'm facing an enormous amount of academic pressure,"Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular?"
It's just a huge amount of work that I'm struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety,"It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure."
Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though?,Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to?
yes it's all virtual though,Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief.
That is a good idea. Do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things?,"When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday (+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time."
"I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college?","I honestly didn't eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings."
"okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down?",I would suggest talking to the professor or an academic advisor to explore strategies that could help you improve
okay but is it normal to be upset?,"Of course, it is normal to feel upset. However, you should not blame yourself. No one is perfect."
Okay that makes me feel better,I am glad it does :D! Anything else I can help you with today?
that's it! thank you for your help,You are very welcome!
hi,Hi. How's it goin'? Are you feeling troubled about something this morning? I know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes. I have a lot of trouble with that myself.
"going smooth, i need to get a nice and a surprise able present for my parent, and at the same time I need to pay my house bills my father understands the situation that my earning is not that much, but my mum will fuck complain that I am taking care of my wife but not her","It sounds like you're having some cash flow issues, right? I can relate to that at a few more points in my life than I'd points in my life than I'd like to recall. It's so very loving and sweet of you to be putting so much thought into the gift! That isn't all that common anymore, unfortunately.. Are you currently working?"
"yes, your are right, I cannot stay in house without paying bills yes, I am working but the income is not that much","It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn't increase along with inflation/cost of living. Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially. Of course you'll need to put your rent and utilities above all else, and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift,"
"that is the major concern, the gift is once in a year and now all my bills are needed to be paid at least before end of the week","I think that you will find out that all your parents really want is for you to be happy and to get to spend some quality family time with you. They love you and want you to be happy and healthy.That is a gift a lot of parents don't get, surprisingly.."
"may be i should use credit card to get her new year present and use my salary to pay the bills and rent my presence is much important likewise i will need to be happy and get rid of this fucking depression, I can't kill my fucking self.","It may sound cheesy to you,, but making a gift for someone is still one of the best ways to tell someone how much you really care. You were willing to give of yourself and your valuable time to actually create a gift."
Hi,Hello How may i help you today?
I had misunderstanding with my friend and I have fear that I am gonna loose her,Can you explain to me what the misunderstanding was about?
"I was bit busy and wasn't able to talk to her for a few days, so she thought I was ignoring her.",Ok i see so she thinks you are ignoring her?
"Yes, she thinks I am ignoring her, but I never meant to do that. I tried to tell her that I was busy with some work, but she thought I was lying to her and now I'm very sad.",I understand how you are feeling about that I would be upset to.
What should I do to still be friends with her? I don't know what to do anymore!,Have you tried to talk to her again recently?
Yes. I even texted her and called her. She opened my messages but didn't respond and she even ignored my calls.,I would give her 2 or 3 days to her self then try to talk to her again
Its been more than 3 days and I have given her time. I don't think I can wait longer. I might loose her.,Maybe you should go up to her house
Due to the COVID cases right now I am trying to not risk the safety of others and myself. I don't know that going up to her house would be the best option at this moment :(,Right i can understand
We have been friends for so many years and I do not know why she is acting like that. I do not want to loose this precious friendship.,I would suggest just keep trying to talk to her and apologize and tell her you been really busy and was not trying to ignore her Send her a apology card in the mail
I appreciate your suggestions. This sounds like a good option. Thank you so much for your help!,your welcome I hope yall will work it out
I hope so as well.,Things will get better for you to
Hope you have a wonderful Holiday.,Have a wonderful holiday to

Hello,"Hello, how are you?"
I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.,So things haven't been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days.
It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade,I'm sorry to hear that. That's a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock?
"Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade.",And the teacher wouldn't budge?
"Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me",Was this for a course that was required for a major?
It was a core class and I needed it to graduate,"Ok, if you're willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn't work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it's offered."
That does sound like a good idea. I am just so disappointed I'm not sure if it is worth it.,I know what you mean. I failed a Calc class once and I felt so empty inside. But I pulled myself together to take it again and passed it. I think you can do it too.
I think you're right. The class is tough and I know I can do it if I put my mind to it.,"Exactly! You've got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you."
It is very intimidating but again I agree with you. Thanks for your input,"You're welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful."
True! I can definitely use the time off before I go back to clear my mind,I hear relaxing music and funny movies can do the trick.
Hi there,hello! how are you?
"I am good, thanks. I hope you're well also.",Is there anything bothering you or upsetting you right now?
"Sure, one of the biggest concerns I have right now is the pandemic Especially with the rising second wave in my city.",What city are you in?
I live in Canada on the east coast.,That must be difficult living in such a big city with the pandemic going on. What are you must scared of or stressed about?
"yes of course. just the sense of fear, anxiety, and paranoia. And helplessness and anguish that people are complacent and selfish and stupid. Keep reading up on exposure sites here like restaurants and gyms, and the culprits are those between 18-35 years old.",I've had similar feelings also. People can be very selfish right now. That's normal to feel that way! How have you been coping with anxiety?
yeah. Like I am scared of being sick at anytime. It could h appen anytime.,It sounds like you're scared of the virus is that right?
"well, I talk with my friend daily on the phone. I also stay sane by staying at home. I work out when I have time, but not so much as before. yeah quite so. It's an invisible enemy, like people cannot believe it's taking effect or they will get it.",It sounds like you're doing a great job adjusting though! Good for you. Talking with people will help a lot.
I can only stay safe for so long but it takes cooperation from my citizens and also the leaders here to be responsible in lockdowns etc. thank you for your kind words I hope you are getting by well also. I try and am kind of used to it by now. But the fear is coming back since two to three weeks ago with renewed cases. yeah and I believe in social support and therapy. It's good to talk out.,"It's hard when we live in a divided world. Some people want this...and some people want that. I would suggest just letting go of the things not in your control, even though that is hard."
yeah I will try and I know what you mean,Do you go to therapy?
"It does feel like I am in an apocalyptic world and self isolated in my safety bunker. And a few months ago, I felt more lonely and claustrophobic. I feel better now. I guess the best and safest place now is my home.","You do what's best for you, that is what is important. Don't worry about others."
"No, I believe in it and I talk openly with my close friends about issues but have only gone for medical therapy a few times. I will try to have my usual health checkup once the pandemic is more in control, and so then I might consider getting a referral yeah that's true. I will keep that in mind",Have you heard of teletherapy? I do that and you don't have to worry about leaving your house!
"not that I have an active and huge problem, but that I don't think it's so bad, as mental illness is so stigmatized. You can go for therapy and talk things over even if you don't have that big of a problem. no I have not done any medical appointments since earlier this year.",Exactly! I totally agree. I love just talking to my therapist. It's so nice just to have someone listen and give feedback that isn't a friend.
I will once I get some more done for my work at home. I see. That's great that you do that. Excellent,Therapy is shown to really help so I strongly suggest doing that if you have the time and money. It really will help.
Yeah I will definitely keep it on my list and won't rule it out I do need to go to my family doctor in person though as I need an annual checkup at least like even the dentist I haven't gone since last year.,Yes that is important. I'm sure it is safe there!
due to the pandemic,Hopefully this conversation helped with some of your anxiety and stress!
Hopefully. And then any mental support can be done via teleheal th like you said.,Sounds like a great plan!
"yes it sure does, thanks for listening and I see that we are pretty much on the same page. It sounds like you are quite coping nicely and optimistic also. So these are great traits. and remain hopeful in such dark and unpredictable times",Thank you! I hope you have a nice night.
"I have no motivaton to work anymore i mean, i am going to work and working but i find myself doding non work tasks like this more and more i dunno i lost interest i am really loyal to my boss, hes a vetearn like me and 72. so ifeel obligated to stay but...i dunno","I understand, that is a tough situation to be in. Burnout is a real emotion."
have you ever felt that way,"Yes, definitely."
what was it like,"I worked for a boss who gave me a chance when I was rather unhirable. I worked there for three years, but I was burning out hardcore. She was kind but she paid me much less than a normal professional would in that position, and took advantage of me."
yup.. i have 3 kids and i am not married. i have no beneftits,"She and her husband ran the business, but I continued to be burdened with extra responsibility, no extra money or benefits. Eventually, the gas station down the hill from us was hiring at a hiring hourly rate than I was receiving from them. I ended up leaving and going back to school."
i feel i could get my kids health insurance if i swithed jobs but i dunno. i feel like i would feel guilty for leaving what did you go for school for,But you have the well-being of three children to worry about. The older gentleman knows how to take care of himself. Communication and Copmarative religious studies
are you still in school,*comparative
i just started going back to school for my masters degree,I'm thinking about going back for my masters but no I am not still in school.
its tough but i am on the honor role you should go b ack to school,"That's excellent. I don't think you should take on this boss's emotions as a reason to stay with a job you're burning out on. I think you should take the small step of looking at what's out there, and maybe having a few interviews. You could try explaining to your boss that you need benefits for the kids. I would be surprised if he did not understand that. And if he does not understand that, well, you will know exactly who you work for, and that will be additional impetus to move on."
with us both being veterans it goes beyond a boss relationship hes like family i feel like id be fucking over the whole nation turning my back on another veteran,Then I would think he would understand even more.
"Well, it has been a hard week. My wife decided to separate from me with the two klids.","Whats been going on? Oh no, that's not good"
I am disgusted....just like President Donald Trump is with the $600 dollar stimulus checks.,Ain't that the truth.
It just isn't my fault. My wife had no right to leave California without me. I made a mistake making California my home.,"I'm sure it isn't, how long had you been together? California is beautiful I know, but it can also be pretty quick paced."
"We were together 10 years. I am just disgusted that it had to happen at this point. Christmas week, of all weeks.",Are you still working?
"I am still working right now. Luckily, California has plenty of money for bureacrats lie myself. I contributed to the marriage for sure. I love my wife and my great kids",It's important that you know that you can feel whatever way you need to about your loss. Its a tough time of year for something like that. Had things been pretty rocky?
"Things like this were sudden. I mean, I never expected her to up and walk out with the kids. The only thing I can think of was that California was getting too expensive and the homeless were taking over LA; that may have spooked her to leave the state.","Wow, that's horrible. It seems you should have some kind of legal authority in that aspect. Is that a big problem out there?"
"I really don't have any discourse. The kids are almost 18. They are twins. Yeah, in her eyes, she seems fed up with the state. She left me for Texas, the state, not the person. I mean, she never mentioned loving, ""Text,"" but the kids are bing into the Dallas Cowboys",It is important that you understand that it seems that she has been thinking of this for a while.
I overhead her say that Texas is a free state and my twin boys do love the Dallas Cowboy's team.,Does she have family there?
"Yes, she does. Both her parents live in Laredo.....big spread, too.",Have you spoken with her since she left?
"Well, she left two days ago. I came home and the furniture and my widescreen TV were all gone. We lived in a small apartment in LA.",That's mid-boggling..
I am D-I-S-G-U-S-T-E-D to the Nth degree.,Do you have any hobbies?
"Any help to get her to come back would help. My hobbies are on hold.....I need to get ""un-disgusted"" first.","Well, I can't make her come back, but I can provide you with some information on how to get through these tough times."
ok. I am all ears.....,"I understand, it can be good to help get some stress out in other ways. Do you excercise? What kind of hobbies do you have?"
I have a gym membership....if they are even open with the COVID-19. Maybe I can just jog or speed walk every day. Perhaps pushups can help?,"I like to run every morning, and it seems to help make alot of stress evaporate."
"Oh, that may just help me relax and think about other things besides my wifey and twin kiddos. Well, your input has helped.","I have found for me anyway, that running is an amazing stress reliever."
hi,Hello
how are you?,"I am good, how are you?"
"I am feeling okay, a little upset.",What is making you upset tonight?
"i was mad, but now i am just upset. My professor put in grades for my class earlier this week. My grade dropped 5 points and i do not have an A anymore.","Just to make sure I understand, you got a bad grade in one of your classes and your grade dropped below an A and you are upset about it."
yes that is right,Have you talked to your professor about the reason for the grade you got that dropped your grade below an A? Often it helps to understand what we did wrong in order to know what we can do to improve.
"Yes I have, she said she explain the rules out in the syllabus and would not change it. SHe gave our whole class a 0 on the final.",Have you reached out to your advisor to speak with them on the situation? Often times your advisor is able to help with advice on what to do in this type of situation.
"No, i have talked to my advisor once and she is not that helpful as she is a professor herself. She told me its okay if I dont have an A, I am still passing. I just worked hard all semester, just to end with a 89.9.",I had a similar situation last semester where I held an A in my class all semester long until the end when it dropped to a B+ so I comletely understand the frustration here.
"Yea i understand that is happens to a lot of people, and we just have to move on and learn. That is hwy im not mad anymore just upset.","I know it is extremely difficult to do that when you really want to keep your grades up, but I know you can get through this!"
I am going to try my best next semester so that this does not happen again.,You will do a great job! '
"I really hope so, thank you","You are very welcome! If you ever need anything else, feel free to chat again!"
"I feel okay now, thank you!",You're very welcome! I am glad I was able to help!
hello how are you today?,"Hello, how are you feeling today?"
a bit sad more depressed its just i keep getting benched at work i'm not really sure what do to *to do,I'm sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset.
i'm not really sure what i'm doing wrong,"Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though."
what can i do though?,Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there's anything going on?
hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though,Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it's happening and not have the opportunity to ask.
yes...hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.,I've also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard
how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy,"I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren't always a reflection of us or how we're performing."
this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person,I can imagine!
"ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done ?","I was in a physical office when I had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. It was hard to wait, but I just kept my head down until the next time she was available. That's what I did."
maybe i can try that. thank you. i'll give it a shot,"I think reminding yourself that if there was a problem with your work they would be seeking YOU out, and not the other way around."
hrm...that's a good point! i hadn't thought of it that way,"Hopefully that mindset can help you stay positive until you have the chance to speak with them, instead of worrying about what you've done wrong. That anxiety feels like what is keeping you down?"
i think that will work. it maybe what's keeping me down. i'll try yoga too. I'll give it a shot and just talk with him when i see him online next time. he isn't online that often because we have 2 separate computers each for our work well...i hope you have a wonderful night! thank you for all your help!,I really hope that helps keep you afloat until you can get some real answers. Worrying about what-ifs is harder than just knowing what's goiong on!
yes i agree,I hope you feel better soon and are able to clear it up!
"thank you for your help! me too. i'll try what you have suggested and see if that doesn't work out well. who knows, maybe it just my project that i'm on.",Have a good night!
"I'm feeling really sad, I thought it was going somewhere",I'm sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay?
"yes I'm okay, I'm so sad. five years , I gave my heart to this girl",Did you guys break up recently?
"yes she broke my heart last night, what did I do wrong?","Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn't blame yourself."
but I gave her my all. I feel so betrayed. I'm feeling so sad I want to jump over a bridge,"I've been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me. We had some space, and then were able to become friends again. And you know what? We ended up getting back together and getting married."
"you think it's my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart","Don't give up, you never know what the future holds. I don't know your particular situation, but it takes two to make relationships work. I don't think you should blame yourself."
"thank you, will try to keep my head up. you think she cheated on me?",I don't know what happened. Is that what you think happened?
well I don't know. why end so abruptly,What did she say when you broke up?
she just said it's over! over the damn phone,Yikes! I'm sure that didn't feel very good.
"not at all, so heart broken","Have you tried talking to her since? Oftentimes people have confused feelings and after some time to reflect, things might change."
"no, she won't pick up her phone",She may need some space to figure things out. I know it's going to be tough but I believe you can get past this.
I could not sleep at night.,That is unfortunate to hear; is this a usual difficulty at night?
Yes. At all nights I feel insecured,It is most uncomfortable when you cannot feel secure in your bed for sleep.
Yes. I feel like there is no one for me. I think I need some support.,Some nights I have suffered from feeling as you describe. Have you discussed this with anyone you feel close with?
No I feel ashamed to discuss my problem. What did you did in your situation?,"In my situation, I met a small pet dog I became close with; he does not like to sleep alone either, so we are now close and keep each other company at night to sleep. Do you think a small pet would be of any comfort to your situation?"
That is a good idea but I don't like dogs. I think I may try it with cats or fishes. What do you think about it?,I understand everyone has their preference about pets or animals.
Yeah Thank you for understanding me. I thought no one understands me.,A cat is a sweet companion and also like to sleep comfortable with people at night.
Yes now I decided to buy a cat. And I think my problems will be sorted after the cat comes.,"I feel alone sometime as well, so do not feel misunderstood. I believe it may be natural for us to feel this way from time to time."
Yes That may be true. But my problems are disturbing my sleep.,"Hopefully, having a new friend who also enjoys sleeping will assist you with this particular disrbance. Hopefully, having a new friend who also enjoys sleeping will assist you with this particular disrbance."
Yes I think so. I will try out this idea for my next night sleep. Do you have any other ideas,Have you ever considered an online friend to chat with before going to bed to help to keep you company?
No I never considered this before.,"This has helped me to calm my mind in the past, since sometimes they can also relieve their mind with you before they sleep as well. Just as we are talking now."
Thank you for your concern.,Do you think this may be a relatable way to help soothe your mind before sleeping?
Yes I think so,There are many different people to chat with and know. Many friendly and funny ones too.
Hello.,Hello How may i help you today?
"I feel terrible right now,",why?
My friends have been leaving me out of Christmas parties. I saw on Facebook my best friend didn't invite me to his Christmas party.,Your friends have been leaving you out of christmas parties is that correct? You knew nothing about the parties?
Yes. My best friend didn't invite me to his party. I think its because I always wear mask and try to obey the CDC guidelines.,I understand how you are feeling i would feel the same way They should not be having christmas parties right now with the Covid going around bad I would not feel bad or terrible about it because you are doing the right thing
Yea it just hurts being left out. He is my best friend and I am not sure what to do. I feel like I need to talk to him abou tit.,yes you should talk to him about it and see why he did not invite you I hope they was wearing a mask and staying 6 feet at the party
I saw photos and they were not wearing masks. In one way I'm glad I did not go. I also think he put a lot of people at risk. How should I bring this up?,I would just be straight forward and tell him you saw the photos of his christmas party Either way if you did know about the party it would not be best if you go just for your safety
Should I talk about him putting others at risk?,yes I believe you should talk to him about that to because he was putting everyone at risk
"Should I do it over txt, Phone, or in person?",which ever is more comfortable for you
Ok so txt would be ok then.,Yes and just talk to him about how you feeling and see what he has to say
Thank you so much. I'm going to do that tonight and see how it goes.,your welcome i hope it goes good and he listens
Thank you have a great night and a Merry Christmas!,thank you Merry Christmas to you to and stay safe.
"Hi, my girlfriend just broke my heart",That stinks. I understand how that can hurt. How long had you been together?
we've been together for 5 years.,And how did she break your heart?
through email. so it hurts even harder,So it sounds like she broke up with you over email rather than face to face or even a call. Not very considerate.
yeah couldn't even do it face to face I'm so hurt,From talking with you I can tell this has been a real blow and need to find a way to move on.
yes it has broke my heart into a million pieces,I've had that happen before to me a few times. It's just the absolute worst feeling.
definitely is. what should I do to get my mind off this awful breakup,"One of your first thoughts might be to get back out there, but really the best thing to do is to start doing things that you like, and that improve you personally."
ok perfect. that will keep my mind occupied,"Do you enjoy any hobbies, or going to the gym? If so, that might be a great place to start."
yes I do. I like playing basketball with friends,"That's perfect, and a great way to get your mind off her while having fun at the same time."
yes it will. but damn it sucks . I will take your advice two more to go,"Glad to hear it. Also, once you feel you're ready, there are plenty of ways to meet new girls. There's the obvious places like online dating or bars, but also some not so obvious like the farmers market or shopping I hope it works out for you in the end. I'm sure it will!"
you there?,"I can tell by our chat that you're feeling better already! Yep, still here. Are you still seeing my messages?"
Hello,Hello! how are you today?
I am not fine,Why is that?
My colleagues always talking bad about me behind,Oh I see. Your colleagues talking about you has you feeling down today.
Yeah. It makes me very sad,I understand why that would be so. I have had a similar situation happen to me before.
How did you solve it?,I totally understand why you are sad. It's very hurtful when someone talks bad about you.
How to solve the issue? I need a solutions,"Well I convinced myself that their opinions did not matter. Also, I confronted a few of them alone to find out why they were talking about me. Another thing that you can do if nothing else works is to move to another department or even another job. But before you do that try and find out what the problem is exactly. Maybe it is not as bad as you think."
I had asked them about it. but they does not reply me I already asked them,In situations like this people tend to feel more powerful when they withhold information. They are more than likely very immature and insecure.
But they are doing many things behind me,"That is a perfect example of immaturity. When people act like this, the person they are ostracizing makes them feel threatened in some way so they treat them badly in order to regain control and security. I had someone that felt very insecure because of me talk badly about me to our mutual friends and even family. What I ended up doing was to completely block the person out of my life and go on living and being me. I showed the people that that person was a jealous, insecure liar simply by being myself."
I have been having such a hard time falling asleep at night.,No need to worry and I am sure you will be able to overcome this.
I sure hope so.,I had same issue with my sleep pattern and I did few things such as stretching exercise one hour before sleep.
What kind of stretching did you do?,"I used few from plate but you can any like arms, legs and etc - full body stretching."
That is a good idea. How did it work,"It was really good and I also did lot of physical work throughout the day which helped a lot in falling a sleep at night. Few other tips - life style changes, breathing exercise, reduce screen use, reduce stress, being more active."
"Oh, those are a lot of choices to try Do you have one that you think works best?","Yes You don't have to try all but just start with two to three first like breathing exercise, stretching and reduce screen usage."
Does this help you stay asleep or just fall asleep,I am sure you will see the difference in few days after trying these. After trying these my sleep patterns improved a lot - I am still doing it. Please let me know if you need any further help.
Sure. How was your mood after getting sleep?,Amazing feeling when you have sound sleep
"Yeah, I would imagine everything seems better with sleep",Hope suggestion I have given enough if not please let me know if you need any more help.
Hello.,"Hello, how are you?"
Not good.,"What's wrong, do you feel like sharing?"
"Well, my girlfriend and her grandmother are extremely depressed. The husband of her grandfather is driving everyone nuts with his yelling. Nothing makes him happy.",I am so sorry to hear that. Sounds like your girlfriend and her grandmother could use some time away from her grandfather.
Kind of hard when he is the one that owns the houses. Doesn't seem right to leave him. He is going through dementia right now. He always supported them. Just sucks now he is causing so much sadness. He sees me like a son but end of the day. I have to do right by my girlfriend. I love her and her family.,"His dementia is causing him to become upset? Your right he does need to be around family and needs love and support, and you are not doing wrong being on your girlfriend side."
Yeah. He keeps going to the VA and they keep saying he is losing brain mass. Wish everyone else knew how to deal with him. Doesn't seem like everyone is equipped to deal with this kind of stress. My girlfriend already has enough on her plate with her chronic illness. Mostly the arguing starts when he tells her to eat 'normal' food. Which everyone has to keep reminding can kill her.,Is there any way you guys could get a nurse that deals with patients that have dementia to help him out?
"Well, problem is that he is extremely fit and stubborn. That could be a solution. Not in his current state though... He would lose his mind. He is a veteran... so. He could lose it.","What about getting a nurse, would make him lose his mind? It would be in his best interest to help him and others around him."
"He thinks everyone is out to get him. He was in Vietnam for years and left him with guns without ammo to protect a post. So with that in mind... who knows. Could work out. But he has tackled medical personnel before. You could imagine the trauma that encourages that crazy mindset. However, I think I got a good idea what to suggest. At least to my girlfriend and her family. You left I guess. Interesting. Okay well good bye Man.. not even a proper good bye.",im so sorry im still here if you would like to talk
Hello,Hello how are you doing?
I’m doing OK. I’m just a little anxious and nervous about my upcoming exams.,I am sure you are trying the hardest you can
I think I am. But these virtual classes are very difficult.,Have you tried looking for guidance from your peers?
"It is much easier to lean on other students when we are in a class. But with virtual, it is much more difficult.",I understand how you are feeling. It is nice to have somebody to lean on during difficult times.
I just have to focus on my studies and not let what is going on impact my studies.,I believe in you and i think you will do great!
Do you have any advice on keeping me focused?,What is your exam on?
Economics and Business Law.,You should find a nice quiet spot to study. Maybe find something to feel you calm which will help you stay focused.
"Good advice. I usually study in my bedroom, but that leads to distractions, such as TV and others wanting to talk.",Also make sure you are comfortable and have good lighting. That should help to.
Yes. I just have to buckle down and focus. Any advice for my anxiety?,Do you have any music you like listen to? I always find music to be calming.
Yes. Good point. Might try some yoga too. Thanks!,I hope i was able to help you and wish you best of luck.
Hi,hello
I am having trouble with depression lately after I had a sister pass away a few months ago in an unexpected fire.,"Oh no, i am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating for you"
"Yes, it has been extremely hard.",How are you feeling now?
I am feeling extremely sad and like I don't feel like doing anything.,"Have you seek therapy? Even if they can't lessen the pain, at least you have a place to vent out"
"I have not for this particular issue, I tried it in the past and didn't like it too much.","You can ask around to see if your friends know anyone good. If not, I'd suggest joining a group of people of the same problem where you can talk to each other"
"I think that is a really good idea, I hadn't thought about seeking out others with the same situation. Have you ever experienced anything like this in your life?","Yes I have, I lost one of my friends by suicide, It's very difficult and took years for me to somehow get over it"
"I am sorry to hear that, what types of things did you do to get through it?","I just cried my heart out, I talked to my other friends just to get it out of my heart"
How long was it before you felt normal again?,"2-3 years, at first I thought it was over but once in a while I would think of him and had this sharp pain in my chest. I tried to busy myself with work and other stuff too."
I try to do the same thing.,"I know it's very tough, especially when it's sudden like that but we can only do our best"
Thank you for chatting with me today!,"of course, I hope you feel better"
hi,"hi there, is there anything troubling you today? I am happy to talk about anything you might have on your mind."
"I got a new job in California, and all my families, mother, father, siblings and friends are there in Washington",Ouch that is a very long way. So you feel that you are going to be distanced from your loved ones and might lose touch with them?
i need to take care of my mother and monitor my young ones,I know how it feels to move to another part of the country. I guess you are nervous about it and unsure if you're doing the right thing
"yes, I need to take care of them, although the job gets a big cash","Would you consider relocating with you? they consider, sorry."
and how will I cope? I know nobody over there in California NO,"It is a difficult time to be making new friends, with all the social distancing policies in place"
IT IS ONLY MY WIFE AND CHILDREN THAT WILL FOLLOW ME DEFINITELY,How often would you be able to visit your parents and siblings?
I do do that often,I think that they will still know that you love and care for them no matter how far away you are
but they will definitely need me,Are there any comparably paid jobs that you could take that do not involve moving?
no for now,I do understand that the job market is really difficult right now. Would your siblings not be able to take care of your parents though?
I am not sure of that men,Do you feel that they are not committed enough to your parents?
"like, I am seriously worried yes",It is very difficult to know what to say. It is a big worry and I wonder if you can be happy in your new environment if you can't be sure that what you've left behind is okay Is it possible that you are worrying unnecessarily though?
"no only worried most about my mother, she will not leave dad",Have you considered looking into other forms of help that your parents could have when you are not there? There are organisations that could check in on them
she feels more happy while seeing me,I am sure that she'd not want you to sacrifice your happiness and financial security though
ok,It is good that you love your mum so much and are worried about her happiness.
let what organization can do that?,I am not sure to be honest. You could try contacting your local Citizen's Advice Bureau?
"okay, I will do that right now, I will be happy if I can see such",I hope that I have been able to be of some help to you You need to press quit now ... I can't do it from this end : )
yes thanks a lot,"you're welcome, have a lovely day"
Hi,How are you?
I am good. How are you?,I doing well. How may I help you?
I had a fight with my best friend.,I understand that you have a dispute with your friend. Is that correct?
"Yes, She asked for a help and that day I couldn't make it.","What kind of help, if I may ask?"
She wanted me to take her for the shopping and I was busy that day. She thought I was making excuses,I completely understand your frustration. Sometime work life balance is overwhelming.
I was so upset that she was not ready to understand and created a fight . I was angry on her.,Have you discuss your frustration with her?
"yes, but still she thinks that I was making excuses that day. She is not ready to listen.",Experts says that when someone get emotional waiting some time might help reduce the tension.
You mean should I give her time?,"That is correct. After some time, when emotion is down, you both can have a discussion about the incident."
We have been friends since childhood. For this reason I don't want to loose her. I will try your suggestion. Thanks,Thank you. Anything else I could help you with?
I will wait and try to talk to her after a while. Hope it will work. Do you have any other thought which I can try?,I don't have any at this point in time.
No problem. Thanks for all your help. bye,Bye
Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well.,Well I can help you study if you'd like?
How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material...,What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study!
"My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted.","I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version."
"Wow, that's actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me.","Don't worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don't have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot."
That is true. I will reach out to her now.,"I'm sure you will do just fine, you can do it!"
I still have some self-doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past...,"Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam."
I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well.,"Yes, thats the spirit it works for me!"
I will give it a try!,Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go?
"No, I should go study now. thank you for your help.","Of course anytime, have a goodnight!"
You too! Wait! I have another concern.,"Yes, what is that?"
Do you have any tips for staying cool under pressure while I am taking my exam?,"Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over."
That is great advice. I will certainly try and get a good night of rest.,Great anything else?
Nope :),"Okay it has been nice chatting with you, feel free to end the chat now, goodbye."
Hi there,"Hello, how are you today?"
I'm not feeling great. I applied for a job recently which took a lot of time. I now have an interview and it's in 3 days. I'm getting really nervous about this because I think I need longer to prepare.,"I know how you feel, I have often felt anxiety before a job interview. What makes you feel that you are unprepared?"
The thing is I'm really good at interviews but usually it takes time to prepare. It's a corporate interview so I need to prepare behavioural answers to certain scenarios. In the past this has taken me a week to learn and record to memory,Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses? That could possibly speed up your preparation time.
Yes perhaps. I need to draw on previous experience so I think I'll need to prepare. I'm just so busy at work these days I just don;t think I'll have the time.,I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation. Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time?
"Yes this is very stressful. Have you ever had a similar experience and if so how did you handle it? Potentially but this is very short notice, usually I have to provide more notice for leave from work.","Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days. Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?"
Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances. I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days.,"That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort."
"Tanks , I think I need to stay positive about this. Not sure how to handle my interview nerves however?","Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident. Do you think any of these ideas might help?"
There are actually some great suggestions there. The naked idea is a classic and it did make me smile. I think I am aiming for perfection when I think I should try and relax and just give it my best shot. That does help actually!,"Be confident in your abilities. You are the right person for the job, and if the interviewer does not see that, it is their failing, not yours. You will do great."
"Thanks for that. I think the key to this is confidence so I'll go with it. Feeling more relaxed about it all now,",Excellent. I am very happy to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
No that's great. Thanks from your help,You are quite welcome. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Have a great day.
I am sad,"I sometimes feel sad too, these days have been really difficult"
Its very stressful now that I don't have work,Since when have you stressed In life all comes and goes
Since last week when I was fired It am struggling to pay for food I can only eat bananas And I only have 0.05 cents that only enough for one banana,I was also in your position I found a part time job in amazon turk and also in GoPuff they hire without too many requirements May I suggest you to look into those options? Do you have any friend who can support you while this passes
I work for amazon turk too. It's the only way I can afford my banana based diet,I try to find the best HIT which pays the most
I have friends I can call,I would call them in order to get some cash while you go back on track
"Their name are Plantain, Cavendish and Musa acuminata They are really nice","Great names, they sound nice. A good friend is a treasure"
"Yes, those are all my girlfriends. I'm very good friend's with one of their husbands, Dole.","I always try to see the positive side of every situation, they always happen for a good reason"
He had helped me in the past.,And do you live by yourself ?
"We took many great vacations to South and Central America to India, China and Africa Which is where all types of bananas grow. We flavored so many bananas",South america is awesome I love it. People there are very positive outgoing even though their countries are not developed
I live alone. Just me and 349 garden knomes,I love bananas I think we could live eating only fruits vegan people only eat fruits and vegetables
I need to support my garden gnomes children. They will starve if I can't find a job quick!,I sometimes do fasting it helps
Maybe I should move to South America and open my own farm,I am sure you will find what you need soon
Last night I had a bad dream,That is a great idea hope you invite me to have one of the fruits you grow What was it ? What was the bad dream about ?
That I only 467 gnomes That I only had I LOST ONE OF MY GNOMES I JUST LEFT HIM BEHIND,I would be happy with all this gnomes
SOMEWHERE SCARED AND CRYING IN THE RAIN,Is it cold up there?
"And then the HORRORS, the rest of my children starved RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES",In these times of pandemic is good to be careful with temperature changes
And then they SHRIVLED INTO NOTHING I was devastated,I would try to think about the good things life have Think that tomorrow the sun will shine again
WOW you're right!!! Thank you so much for your help I have a new purpose,"That's great to always have a new purpose, go get them!!"
I see the true goal of my life Thank you,Every dream that you have comes with the power to make it come true
THANK YOU,Thanks to you because you really make me open my eyes
is anyone here,hi!!
hi\,how is your day?
"no to good my friend is a drunk and nobody not even her husband tells her that hse is having a problem, so i did tell her now she is spreading lies about me and what a terrible person i am",oh no that's really not good
"no I mean she really has issues she gets drunk and mean , falls of chairs in bars and that at least 3-4 times a week, her husband does not say a word since she iis in my oppinion verbally abusive to him",ok ok I could understand now
so what do you think i should do u still there?,"What you have did so far is absolutely correct You worry for your friend is also correct, I think you need to be with your friend in this situation whatever she says about you yeah I am here"
"she does not talk to me anymore blocked me on social media, and goes around and says I am just trying to cause trouble for her",I think you just give some time to your friend to realize what she is doing now.
she is going to loose custody of her child if her ex find out she is always drunk,oh no it seems to be a big problem
"I think so and there is no talking to her she does not admit that she has a problem, she is trying to casue issues between me and my husband",If she is not accepting her fault directly you need to find some other way to make her realize her current situation and consecquence
"like what for example, talking does not work? so call the cops on her?",I don't don't calling cops as good. We need to do in some other way to make her realize .
"not sure what the best way is to deal with this, or should I just step back and let it be if even her husband does not care?",you can talk to her mother and some other persons close to her and who really cares her
I might try that. Thanks for listening,you are welcome.
Hello Nice meeting you,"Hi there, how is your day going?"
Fine and yours? I have anger issue,"Uh oh, you feel you have an anger issue? What's going on?"
How can you help me resolve it?,Is there anyone you can talk to about what you are going through?
I get angry easily and it has affected a lot of my relationships. I don't seem to have anyone to talk to.,How do you feel it is affecting your relationships?
I get angry at the slightest provocation.,"I understand how it can feel like you have no one to talk to. Are you in school age, maybe a counselor could help?"
I'm not getting it funny anymore,What do you mean?
I'm an adult Im a single mom,I was angry for a period of time after my husband passed away and I get where you are coming from I am also a single mom now
It's glad you can see the world from my perspective. How did you overcome it? Oh that makes the 2 of us.,"Day by day, focusing on my kids and how I want them to be happy. I also found a great support group in my community. Have you checked in to something like that?"
I'm thinking of something like that. I guess loneliness also makes it worse for me. I live alone...,I know how hard it can be to live and feel alone. Do you have any pets?
I don't have a pet but thinking of getting one.,"I think that's a great idea! My dogs have really helped, they provide great comfort."
I will get a cat 🙀 then. I heard they are a great companion.,"That sounds like a really good start in helping with your loneliness, it's great that you are thinking of ideas that will help move you forward."
Yes you've been great too. I love how you helped me handle my issues. You're awesome.,"Thank you, that's nice to hear. Would you be interested in looking at the library for resources on groups or counseling?"
Yes that's another great idea. I'm gonna check on our local library to get some books 📚,"If you feel less comfortable in person, I bet there are many groups and information online as well."
Where are you?,At home. Yesterday was great weather here.
Okay 👌,"I have some errands to run, but I hope our chat helped and I hope you start feeling better. I think your idea to get a cat and also to check out some resources is a great start in helping you heal."
"hi, how are you? My friend, My best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts","I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before."
its so annoying and hurtful,Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level
"i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful",I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though.
"I know, but its hard when you are the one still stuck, Im not ready for change.",Yea it was hard for me too. Thats the thing about change it just happens. I would do something focusing on yourself. Trying to make yourself feel better.
i could try to focus on myself,Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh
"I agree, i need to focus more on myself","Good, im glad you can realize that! Some people cant"
its hard to but I know that its time to focus on me more,"Great, any ideas on what you would like to focus on?"
"focus on me, doing things by myself instead of with my friend. going to eat, spa time, me time, only with me. then allow myself to make new friends do you have any suggestions that i can focus on","Those are great ideas actually, When i want some me time, i usually go for a nice long hike or run."
"i thinks hikes and runs are good too, they actually are peaceful and makes me focus on life","Yeah, it helps i think even down to a chemical level. Kinda like a great reset for our minds"
"reset of our minds, interesting. i will try hiking for sure. thanks for your input.","Great, i just want you to know that your friend moving to a different person is not your fault. Its an unfortunate side of life."
"Hello, I need some advice as I have a depression as I found out my wife cheated on me with my friend","HI, how are you?"
"I am depressed a little bit, feel devastated.",Its very sad but try to come out from depression because its not good for your health
I can't sleep at night proverly as well. Feels like all my friends are talking about me,"Oh!, please don't feel like this try to do some yoga before sleeping"
"I've never tried yoga before, how exactly does it helps?",yoga make you feel relax try this yes try it make you feel better Yoga is relaxing tool
I can try tonight but don't know where to start. Do you know ny resources where to get instructions for yoga to make depression go away?,try to watch some videos and follow some yoga trainer Just from your chatting i feel how much you are in depression
Ah ok I will try thanks. Anything I can do at work? As I feel unfocused all the time and thinking about betrayal and divorce.,Try those things that make you feel happy before work like funny videos I hope i can help you
"Unfortunately I have no time, I wake up at 5 AM and my shift starts at 6. I just feel that all my colleagues have talks about me all the time behind my back.",Long time age I'm in same situation so i try those things so those help me to come out from this
"Should I try to date somebody or it is too early how do you think? I know one woman is really into me at work but I am quite not into her, only consider as a friend",Yes its too early try to fix your old relationship before move on new
"My wife already moved out and divorce probably will take few month, I guess I still love her",Oh! so than i think you need to move on from this
"ok, thank you very much for you help and assistance. Will try yoga today",Try do relaxing thing that make you come out from this Thanks that you share your problem with me
Thanks gain.,Your welcome
Hi I am really very angry with my friends for not inviting me,Why is that?
"I didn't did any anything wrong to my friends but they are simply saying they forget me So they no need on me , I am not important person to them","I have been angry with friends as well, but time loves a hero, as they say."
In my all events i am inviting them all but how they Why what happen..?,How long have your friends been neglecting you??
"In last 2 events only , what about you","Any other questions for me? I know it is hard at times, but be strong."
Im so depressed,I am really sorry to hear that.
It just wont end,What is making things so hard?
Now Im in quaritine again cant leave the house I dont have anyone to tak to,I definitely understand that. I also have been having a hard time in quarantine.
Plus my work hours have been cut,"Do you have people you can talk to digitally? Friends, family?"
I have family but they live on the west coast im on the eastcoast,I get that. It can be really frustrating when you feel alone and like you've got no one to talk to. Especially when 2020 seems to be dumping things on you. What have you been doing to pass the time? Is there anything that you've found that makes you feel better?
So my money is now running low and rent is coming due I like to read,That can be handy!
I like to walk on the beach,"Is that something you can do with regularity? Getting out and walking? I know that I've had good luck battling my depression by just finding ways to not be at home. Hiking, going for walks, going for drives..."
Yes I live on the beach but its so cold right now I cant even do that. I feal so isolated Im going to do that tomorrow,"Good! It's hard to start, but it's a good way to start. How far do you plan on going?"
Im going to bundle up and go to the beach. Probably walk down to the pier 1 mile,That will be good. Make sure you can take some time and really appreciate not being in the house. Is there any music or podcats you can listen to while out?
"Thats good advice, Im feeling a little better I can take my iphone for music","I am glad. Practicing mindfulness can really help, and help put things in perspective. Often times we build things up to be even worse than they already are. Being able to be grateful for what's around can help, without diminishing the issues that you are facing."
"Thats good advice, thanks I think you helped me","Remembering that it's okay to be sad and depressed, as much as it sucks, can be helpful in reframing. It's a rough time for everyone and you definitely are not alone."
"Thats true, it just seems like I am alone cause well I am lol","I absolutely get it. I work from home right now so it's just me all day. Sometimes, I literally only talk to my cats. I am a crazy cat lady."
Cats are cool,I had a whole cry and freak out moment when part 2 of quarantine hit recently. I wholeheartedly understand. Do you have any pets?
I have a Russian Blue cat ssmart very smart cat,"Smart cats are the best. They know when you need cuddles, which it sounds like you do! Also means you aren't alone. ;) Cat needs ya! As much as they don't want to admit it."
He's my buddy for sure. Makes me happy to think of him,"If you are healthy/feel comfortable with going out, you could consider volunteering at an animal shelter. You'd get to interact with some folks, some animals, and add something to the resume. I don't know if you are likely to get hours back at work or what you do, but that could be fun!"
Thats a good idea I'll look into it. Well we better wrap this hit up?,"I believe it needs to be a minimum of 20 minutes and we are at 17 right now. For the max that is, lol."
Oh sorry thought it was 15 minutes. So where are you at?,"West Coast of all things! WA st, so lots of hiking for me. It's been helping so much."
I moved from Renton to here in Myrtle Beach SC,Oh hey! So all of your family is here then. What prompted the move?
Got real tired of the weather and people there Everyone friendly here and actually talk to one another,"Ha. I believe that. I was born and raised in Puyallup, so it's all I know. i couldn't ever think of leaving. Welp, thanks for the conversation, I hope I helped. Cuddle the cat, enjoy the beach, and remember this is all temporary!"
Have you ever left the state,"lol, I have."
Hello I would like to talk to you regarding my daily stresses,"sure, please go ahead and share your story"
"pretty much being social isolated due to the pandemic, trying to finish up my studies at the same time, and what's going on in the world with regards to the pandemic. My physical and mental health aren't great, and I am not eating as well as I should or sleeping as well as I should. I guess we all go through that in different ways with the pandemic now","it sounds like you are having depression, have you shared your problems with anyone?"
"yes sure, I chat with my friend everyday on the phone and that helps to talk about each other's day and my thoughts and feelings, observations with the world etc.",that's great! Friends can be big help
"I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work. Then it's a vicious circle in which the next day I wake up late, and my day starts late, and so to get as much done, I repeat the same damaging cycle.","If you have time, spend at least 1-2h everyday outdoor. You can talk a walk in the park or just simply go to the stores"
"So I am having real trouble breaking this pattern. And because I work once or twice a week and not during the day, I don't even have the motivation or need to wake up early. I go out only for personal errands and that's once every week or two weeks. I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking.","In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier spending too much time indoor is very damaging to your mentality. Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate."
"My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking. Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym.","I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people"
"Now I just do a lot of time nothing but on the computer or in my studies. A lot of the time aimless, not even studying that well or using my time well. And I don't have the same motivation to work out that much at home, which I used to do a lot. exactly. I understand your feelings too on that. A lot of selfish people inviting others indoors or going out, even a few months ago when the cases were just dropping and they didn't take enough time to wait but immediately lift their own restriction and go out.","I'm also sick of the repetition too. Everyday I go to work then go home and just get stuck there all nigh every day. However, we need to tell ourselves that this too shall pass"
"But even when there were a lot of cases, there are some people on my floor that walked freely in and out many times in one day when it wasn't safe for anyone. And I didn't get that at all and that was when I was angry and anxious of their actions. Because that risked my safety too sorry to hear that you have similar repetitions. That's how it feels. Everyday is the same. And when I talk with my folks on the phone, I have nothing new to share except about the pandemic, because that's the only thing new, and I only call the once a week. But yes, I do believe that it will pass at some point.",that's the right way of thinking. You're doing this not only for yourself but for everyone else
yeah that's why I told myself early on I am doing this for everyone and I couldn't compromise no matter what. Perhaps too stringent but that was my thinking.,"I try to stay away from the news or talking about covid, mostly because it's gonna be the same information and only depresses us even more"
And it's better now and I am kind of used to this endless cycle. I used to feel even lonelier and claustrophobic. I see. Well I do hope and it does sound like you are adapting to this well so far and staying sane. So that's good,I don't think I am better than you but we have to try nonetheless
"And what sucks even more is that my city is just beginning its second wave as of about two weeks ago. So it's just starting to ramp up Yes I agree. Just stay strong. And one thing I told myself is that years from now I can imagine myself in that future time and thinking back to a dark, bad year, and say and think to myself that I got through it and that there was an end to the dark tunnel. And that there is an end to this.","it's the same for me, businesses are forced to tighten again which is grim. However, the only think we can do now is take 1 day at a time and hope for the best."
"So that did help even though the future may be relatively far, I was vividly picturing that emotion of that time in the future. yeah good luck to you. And at least your city is deciding to close for the better. My city hasn't even made the call yet even though this is probably the optimal time to do so, early on in the spread where it's controllable. I am sure you will get through this great. We can do it. Actually talking to you now, I feel renewed hope. just kind of summarizing my thoughts and feelings.",I believe the same as long as we hang in there. Get help from your friends and family
So thank you for that and for listening and understanding. Yes will continue to do that,It was nice talking to you too
im very upset,I'm sorry. Would you like to tell me about it?
yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can't be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend,What bothered you about that?
well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first,I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen?
"yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was GONE",I'm so sorry that happened to you. I would be very upset as well.
i've known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they're not even officially together,Did you speak to your friend about it?
"yes, so i called her and asked her if she saw my bag and she got defensive she started talking about how much money he has and how he doesnt have to steal",It is sometimes hard for people to believe someone they care about could do something bad.
but she should care about me more!! she barely knows him.,"I have been in a similar situation with a friend and her husband; when he was exhibiiing bad behavior, she did not want to see it in him. I agree that she should value you your friendship more than someone she just met."
"last time we went out for brunch, he literally tried to make her pay for it! that's not the behavior of someone that has money like she claims. she's delusional",It sounds like you are worried about your friend putting her trust into this guy.
im worried about how i'm going to get my switch back. i dont have money for a new one im thinking of calling the cops,"I think if you talk to her again and tell her you are looking out for her best interests it may help open a conversation. If you do end up calling the cops, at least you will have tried to speak with her first."
"i should tell her that i am thinking about calling the cops, at least or maybe not cuz she might tell him then he can get rid of it. i think she is working with him, maybe, or at least covering for him","Knowing your friend, do you really think she would do that?"
"i think she would cover him, maybe, or try to avoid the truth. but no i dont think she would plot with him","It sounds like you really care about your friend, and want the best for her. She may not realize this but you are doing the right thing."
i'm sure she'll come forward if i give her time. thank you for your help,I hope that she does the right thing and that you can stay friends. Good luck to you.
Hi..how are you doing today..,Hi..Iam doing good..How are you today
Iam facing post partum depression as I recently had a baby..,Oh I can relate to that because I also had a baby a year ago and I can understand what you are going through..
How did you manage to deal with that..,Do you have anyone to help you with the baby so that you can have some time to relax for yourselves.
No my husband works in different city and my parents live in a different country..I dont have anyone with me to take care of the baby..,Oh that will be difficult for you..Can you afford a nanny..
Yeah I can afford but iam skeptical because of the pandemic..,"Dont worry,just love your baby,when the baby sleeps,try to have some rest and practice yoga and meditation when you have time ,they helped me a lot whn Iam dealing with the depression.."
Oh Thank you for the suggestion..I will follow that..,Also you can connect on online forums and find help by chatting with other moms who are fcing the same issues..
Oh that is a great idea..I will certainly look in to it and will consider it..,Iam glad you like them..I hope you will be better soon and Iam positive about that..love your baby..
Thank you so much for the help .I really appreciate it .,No problem..happy to help..Is there any thing else you need help with?
Nothing..thank you..bye..,ok bye
This service is extremely helpful..,Iam glad to help you provide with emotional support..
i am feeling sad. my boyfriend left me out of the blue.,I am so sorry for hearing that. Do you want to talk more detail about that?
"yes, i want to. i am unable to concentrate in anything. i feel so negative about my life. what is the point of this relationship then ?","You seem really focus on just one person. Life is rich. Think about other important people in your life such as parents, friends"
i can understand all of this. may be i need some time.,"Yes of course you should take your time as long as you want and you can do it, one day you can leave all those problem"
hoping the same. want to be the happy person like i was before.,"Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you'll try them out Just chatting with you, you seem very a smart, strong girl. Do not be upset about things you can't control."
i think i should divert my concentration on something else.,"For sure, what else we need to talk about?"
it really hurts when the person means you the most becomes unavailable out of the blue without stating any reason. nothing. thanks for your support anyways. i am glad talking to you.,I feel the same way.
thank you then.,"Sure, is there anything that I can help you"
none. how are you coping up with the current situation?,"Kinda Ok, but struggling with some issues such as eating unhealthy"
why can't to cook in your home? is there anyone to help you ?,"not sure, i can cook myself however the situation pushes me unhealthy choice somehow lol. Btw, it helps for your current mood, does not it? I mean we are talking about other stuffs which make you think about your problem less?"
hello,"Hi, how are you today?"
could be better how are u,"I'm sorry you're not feeling great, what's wrong?"
i cant afford a house,"I'm sorry to hear that, we're in hard times right now for sure."
Ya I am barely making it through Christmas and see my sister with a house I wish I had one,Are you in an apartment or rental situation of some sort?
3 bedroom apartment with 6 people,Have you looked into a loan for a house? Sometimes the payment on a house is close to rent payments.
Ya we are looking into it,I know sometimes people get a loan and then have a roommate move in and charge rent to help with the finances as well.
"Ya that does sound interesting, I could have my brother in law move in",Could be something to help you out at least temporarily. I know it seems very intimidating but it'll be ok.
thank you that is a big help,"You're very welcome, I hope you have a great holiday and feel better knowing you have options."
"thank you, and hope you have a great holiday too",Thanks!
your welcome Oh and a happy new year,"You as well, stay safe!"
"For sure, you as well. I tried to last the whole time lol",I think we're good!
My friend borrowed money from me but she won't return it now,I am sorry about that. It is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down. is that waht you are feeling? Disappointment in your friend?
"Yes,i am very dissapointed because i trusted her completely.",I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money?
"What did you do to come out of the tricky situation? Yes,it was for me,a total of $10000","Oh, That is a very large amount of money. I can understand your being upset with them Have you talked to them about the money and returning it?"
"Yes,i am very very upset.What would you do in my position? Yes,she just sounded non-comittal,saying that she will return it when she can",I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments?
"Yes,i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer",Were you speaking on the phone or in person? Is this a financial burden for you? Would you consider this person a good friend? Would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore?
"We were speaking on phone because i wanted to set up a physical meeting where we could discuss the logistics Yes,it is a financial burden because this is money i was saving for a venture",That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone.
"Yes,this is a really close friend from way back and i would be devastated to lose the friendship It is difficult to judge on the phone yes,which is why i wanted a physical meeting but she snapped at me and said that she will just pay me when she can",I see. I am very sorry about that! it is very difficult when a friend betrays your trust like that.
"Yes,very difficult",It sounds like you are doing what you can. It is very nice of you to have been this patient.
How do you suggest i shoulp proceed?,Is the friendship more important than the money? That is what it came down to for me.
And you chose what?,"If you can not get her to meet with you, perhaps it might be time to seek advice from a lawyer? That is providing that you are willing to possibly lose a friend."
Thank you very much for the advice,you are welcome. Good luck! I hope you find resolution and find a way to save your friendship!
"Hello, I'm having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company.",hi! i'm sorry to hear that how is your work going so far
The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting.,"you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID?"
no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work.,I understand how anxious you are right now Can you give me some more info on your job
well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it's a bit scary. i'm a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i,"i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front-line workers are our real heros"
am based on a quota. I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that's almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7-10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn't feel like it to me.,did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead / Warehouse Supervisor of your group
I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn't give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... Yes and they always say the same thing. You need to get your numbers up but it's a catch 22 you can't possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas,you are doing your best and are working really hard
so,"just a thought - did you try changing roles within the warehouse to a different position? or try checking with the manager regarding this you have 5 years exp, i'm sure you deserve a better role and pay"
I am a felon and I have a bachelores degree in business management. I am desperately trying to get out of the quota based work areas,"i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference"
Do you know how incredibly hard it is to serve your time in jail for 3 years and get out and can't find a job except scrubbing floors or cleaning shit or servinge tables my manager doesn't give a shit,"thats hard,.. but you can do it"
do what work at burger king for $7.25 an hour,do your best in your job! hard work ultimately pays off!
I'm not so sure if that's true anymore. It's not what you know.... it's who you know and with my felony my reputation is nothing but shit my real worry is that this is one of the highest paying jobs in my area. $16 an hour plus almost unlimiteed overtime for a felon even with a degree that's phenominal in florida.,It sounds like you feel you are not heard and thats why you are pushing yourself hard do you feel that way
America is just not fair.,Its great that you are working hard despite whatever you faced and I assure that this will help you build a great future in this country
"I will try and talk to my manager, thanks for trying to help me out. have a nice dayl I doubt it. this country is about to fail. i've already made plans to go to brazil then paraguay",I wish you all the best Sean! I wish you good luck in all your future endeavors i hope everything turns out for the best
hi,Hey! How are you?
trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once :(,What are these thoughts? :)
Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast,"Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while"
"tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing","A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright :)"
I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate,"Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently"
i pretty much have to do it constantly,"Not constantly. because then you won't have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing"
yeah maybe its as simple as that. I know Im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part,"Yeah, maybe. But always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop"
right. I will try and start that more today and commit to it,yes that's the spirit! And with that mind set good things will always come to you!
"yes i agree. when i consistently use meditation and positive attitude, any bad things are defintely minimized","Yes, as long as you keep focused and not divert into any other thoughts :)"
yes. do you meditate? ',"I do it once a week and it really helps. I used to do it more often when I felt I couldn't do anything right, so always do it according to the situation"
do you want to keep talking or should we wrap up? i could go either way,Yes If you want to
I might go and have some breakfast It was great chatting :),"But im here for you but if we are done lets wrap it up :) yes, byee"
Hi. I'm feeling depressed and overwhelmed.,"Please tell me more about it, when did it start?"
"It all started earlier this year. I live with my parents because I'm unable to care for myself , due to a disability. Well my dad has dementia, and my mom, who was the primary caregiver, was diagnosed with cancer. She's been in and out of hospital so now its up to me to keep everything afloat., I'm having a really hard time with it. Between work, school, keeping up the house, and caring for my dad, it's a lot to handle.","That's very exhausting doing that much, I really feel bad for you, you're a strong person to be able to handle so much by yourself"
"Thanks. But I'm really not that strong. It's really exhausting and overwhelming. My depression and anxiety are through the roof, and honestly, I'm not sure how long I can keep this up.",Someone else would have collapsed already. Do you go outside a lot?
I actually am not able to go outside. Its been a few weeks.,Maybe that's why your depression got worse. We need the sun and fresh air to feel better
"i try to avoid going out at all. It's hard for me to get around. Even taking the bins out is a struggle. I can't even walk my dog. I just open the door and he goes out , does his business and comes back.","I understand it's hard for a person like you. However, as I said, from my own experience, staying indoor for a long period does more harm than good You don't have to go far, even just out in your backyard to have some sunlight as the first step is good enough"
maybe i will try that. little by little I'm really scared of the pandemic. I don't want to get sick.,"Just take one step at a time, I believe you can do it as long as you put your mind in If you don't get close to anyone and wear a mask, you should be fine"
"Yeah, that is what they are saying in the news. It's just that folks out here are idiots and don't want to follow protocols. We are in a red zone where I live","it's pretty bad here too but as long as you avoid crowded place, you'll be fine"
Hopefully this is all over soon,we have 3 vaccines candidates now so there's hope
"This is true, but I hope they are researching and doing it right and not just trying to come up with a vaccine quick.","I don't think that's the case,, these companies know how much they'll have to pay if they rush and push out a defective product"
Thank you so much for your advice and reassurance. I feel better about things now.,"No problems, we all feel the same right now so I just try to cheer everyone up"
"Hello, My name is DJ, Thank you for your time. How are you?","Hi, I'm Vicky! I'm doing pretty well :) How can I help you through your issues today?"
"I'm glad to hear that you are doing well. As far as the issue, I'm not sure how you can other than listening and encouraging.",No problem! I would love to be a listening ear for you to talk about it and work through anything stuck in your mind.
"Yeah, she is visiting for a couple of days. It is great to see her and our Grand-baby. He had to work so he's not here. He's a great guy to everyone else. But not to her. We can see how their relationship has decreased and the little one is copying his poor behavious",omgsh I'm so sorry to hear that. Is this your daughter's partner? I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship before and know how difficult it can be
"It is good for her to be here with us. She can talk with her Mother and pray together. Yes, this is her husband. I'm sorry to hear you went through the emotional abuse. It is rough. I've got to be careful not to react to him.","From my personal experience, I can say that your support really means everything to her. She may not want to admit the truth to herself, but with your support, I believe she can find the strength to get out of the relatioship"
"Yeah, she does know what is going on between them and how it is impacting the little one. And, I am thankful she trusts us with what is going on. They both need support and strength.",Yes I completely understand. It's a very delicate situation. I've read multiple times that it takes an average of 7 times to leave an abusive relationship (even though I think I tried even more times than that). She will hopefully one day gather the courage to realize she doesn't deserve to be treated badly You are amazing for being her support!
"Yeah, she has a good support system with her Mon and a couple very close friends. It;s one day at a time, listening and being available.",That's seriously great to hear! I don't know what the exact situation is but I do know that she needs all the love she can get
"That is for sure. She will talk things through with her Mother, they have always been close and I help when needed. I'm thanksful she leans on on us. The little one loves coming for a visit.","that's all you can do for now until the day that she will be able to take steps to leave the bad situation I hope that this will be a productive visit from them. At the very least, they'll be able to see what real love looks like from you guys :)"
"Yeah, Thank you. I've got some ideas chatting with you. Vicky, Thank you. Have a Merry ""Safe and fun"" Christmas. Thanks for listening.",I'm so happy to hear that. I would love to help anyone I can to get out of an abusive relationship because it was the darkest period of my whole life. I wish you the best of luck and Merry Christmas! I think you have to end the conversation on your end.
"Talking, listening, praying and making good memories. Recipe for love.",<3 agreed. Unconditional support is everything.
"Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there HELLO? no one is supporting me here. ::twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for ""the partner's reasons"". the supporter did not respond This test is skewed. No one is here to chat with. even after being matched. Ridiculous. hello????? hello? no other messages except my own are showing up.","Sorry, I had a bad connection. Hello, what can I help you with?"
Hi. i wasn't sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years. haven't found another one. trying to find one has been challenging,"Just be clear, you're worried about finding a new job?"
"well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful","That is a difficult position to be in. It is a hard time, but there's always a way to persevere."
yeah... i don't know ... i'm not sleeping well because i'm so worried,I could imagine that being a constant worry. I understand how you may feel.
thanks for trying to understand it just seems pretty hopeless,"No problem. I am encountering a similar situation, looking for a well suited job. Have you tried looking in to new career fields that have always interested you?"
"Yeah, I am looking in a variety of fields not much out there that is remote","There are a lot of jobs in technology where the only requirement is learning a few courses, such as programming."
that would be cool. i really enjoy tech,It would be nice to work in a field that you also enjoy!
yes it would. just don't have much energy to keep turning in cover letters and resumes.,"It can seem hopeless right now, but think about how you felt when you were in a better position."
yah thats true you have any ideas on how to be less anxious,That helps me balance things out in my head sometimes. Sometimes we get stuck. It happens.
"yeah, stuck is a good description","Accept that you are anxious so you can control it instead of it control you. Accepting actually makes you less focused on it, because you don't have to wonder about it. I hope that helps and good luck!"
I'm looking for support in regards to a recent break up My boyfriend/fiance seems to be a serial and or chronic masturbator When I looked at his files in his computer it was shocking! Are you there? I am seeking some support in this crazy world? The thing is that his files contained really gross porn and live webcam sites. What should I do? When I confronted him he said it was not him! He lied so horribly! I am heartbroken. I also found out that he has had many different profiles on facebook that are just covert operations. What would you think? Please tell me what advice you would give? His spam folder is full of crap! all of it like Fuck me here and now! Hello there are you there?,sorry i'm here
I have checked his email folders and we have talked about his over the top usage of porn and online dating sites. He has admitted that he is in fact a sex addict! Should I hold on or should I let it go? Just find someone else that I can actually trust?,"First of all, I have a fre questions to ask Does the idea of him being sex addict change how you feel about him?"
What's the fre question? what is fre? Not necessarily . Just the trust issue really.,I would say you should cut tie with him. Being into porn is a serious issue but what's more important is he lied to you about that
We've known each other for years and have been friends for a very long time.. We dated on and off and things just seem to always go back to this weird off place.,I think you can also feel it yourself that there's something not right between you and him
I appreciate your thoughts. So you don't think I should give him another chance?,"This is a wake up call for you I must say, to get away from him I think you should sit down and tell him to take a break, this doesn't mean completely break up but some time for both of you to think it over"
I feel like I really can't trust him and find myself looking through his computer and phone questioning things. makes me feel crazy.,"I understand how you feel, it's not easy to get over this feeling"
Is this a clean site or do people use it for porn chat?,That's why you need some time for yourself to think whether you can forgive him and try to help him or not
I know . That sounds like great advice. Hard to pull off during the pandemic though.,"To be honest, watching porn is normal, however, I feel that if someone is too into it, as in watch it more than 1-2 times a month, it's problematic and won't be easy to fix Do you live with him?"
Ah. I think it's more of a real issue when it comes to controlling himself or using sites because he was single for so long. He is currently staying with me.,"You can ask him to stop doing that for you, if he really cares, he will try"
His latest obsession has been 3d printing. I have found weird sites with ' funny'' dildos on them in his feed and stored data. Do you think he might be gay? Like humor I understand but...,goodness
stored data with adult printed groups on fb! dildos with star wars themes. Immature stuff. IDK.?,"That you have to ask him, tell him to have an honest thought, no judgement, be completely honest with each other"
He laughs when I show him mens underwear. I think maybe that's a sign he's uncomfortable. What do you think?,"Yeah, laughs can definitely be a sign of someone getting nervous Does he have any close male friends?"
Yep That's what I thought too. He does have a few close male friends. Nothing that looks suspicious though.,"Whether he's gay or not, it's hard to say just from a few things, but what's more important right now is for you two to sit down and talk"
I wonder if there is a way to find out why he joined all of these weird servers and is trying to learn code. Is it really for 3d printing or is it to make a secret platform to hide his data etc?,"Maybe it's just simple as he tells you, but you have to talk to him.There is no use sitting here and let all those thoughts and questions consume you"
Have you ever used jatos? or done any surveys for the universities? You're actually pretty good at this!,What is jatos?
It's a link I found while searching but it turns out to be a server that is used for studies.,oh interesting
JATOS,I just use my experience and try to help
just another tool for online studies,Is there any problems you need help with?
I think that You have helped me allot. Thank you!,no problems
I am so stressed.,"Hi, what's going on?"
"I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning. I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along.",Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use?
"It is stressful. I am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because I must switch back and forth. I have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor. My colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly.",Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something?
"I don't have a second screen, but I do have a large TV. I may be able to hook it up via HDMI.",The mute thing is horrible. I have no ideas for that. hahah. I'm looking for help with that too! Yeah try the HDMI hook up you can sometimes find cheap attachements on amazon if you don't have the right connections.
"Sometimes I get really anxious. My ears will be pounding and I feel like I can't hear anything. It is worse when using in ears, because it's like all I can hear is my heartbeat.","yeah if you stream it on your tv, you won't have to wear headphones... that way you can control the volume better too."
That sounds like a great idea. Have you had any weird technological solutions to help you through distance learning?,I'm not really doing any distance learning right now. Just working from home and coincidentally most of my work uses excel. I have constant virtual meetings where I have to show people things via excel. It's pretty tough but I found if I use multiple monitors it makes things easier.
I have considered making impulse buys to help with some things. Do you know about portable second monitor screens for laptops? It seems almost like a thin tablet that you plug in to your laptop. I like the idea.,my second monitor is not portable. I don't know if that would work for me because I work better in one designated spot. So I have 3 monitors on my desk (2 separate monitors and my laptop screen). however something like That would definitely be something I'd look into if I was in school or taking classes
I enjoy portability and minimalism to a fault sometimes. I enjoy being able to work from anywhere. Do you live in an apartment or home?,I think that's a good call! Do you think you can find a deal somewhere on it?
Hello,Hi there how can be of help?
I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don't know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down (obviously) and there doesn't appear to be any real reason behind it.,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue?
I felt this way for a while actually isn't a recent change it's been building slowly over time.,Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same?
I think I know what you mean. It's getting worse. I feel very down.,Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse.
Yeah. I worry that I'll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I'm really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest.,"Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it's good that you have reached out for help for this."
Any suggestions on what to do about it?,There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem.
Ok well there is definitely a problem.,Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment?
not really I don't want to bother other people with my problems.,if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help.
Yeah maybe. I suppose nobody really understands but I could at least speak to them about it.,everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn't mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better.
I don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm willing to at least give it a go.,I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective.
I haven't spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear I don't want any medication.,"are you worried that speaking to a doctor will lead to you being given medication, and you don't want this?"
yes that's right I don't want to take any pills or anything like that.,I know that some forms of depression are caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain and medication in these cases can help. Also psychologists can support with mental health which means that this would not be a rude day involves any medication at all potentially
what do you mean be a rude day.,apologies this was a typo by autocorrect. I meant to say that this would not be a route that involves any medication at all potentially
ok thanks for explaining. I think I'll speak to my sister about this. if this doesn't help I'll look into making an appointment with the psychologist maybe.,That's great. I think the first step is always the hardest but you come across as someone that is willing to seek help and I believe that if you face into this you can overcome it witht he right support.
Thanks for that.,You're welcome.
"Hi, how are you?",Good. How are you?
"Not so good. My girlfriend dumped me months ago, but I can't get over her. Other women just don't appeal to me.",I would be upset after a breakup too.
Thanks. I wish that I could get over her. I'm not sure what I should do.,Have you gone out on any dates since the breakup?
"I've talked to other women. They seem nice, but they all pale in comparison to my old GF.",Talking to other women shows that you are trying to move on.
That's a good way to think of it. It just made me feel worse because it reminded me of something that I don't have. Maybe it will get better.,I understand. It is sometimes hard to give new people a chance when you are comparing them to someone else.
"I wonder what other people do after a breakup. I've asked others, and they tell me to just give it time. How much time, I wonder.",Giving new people a chance might help you move on.
"That's something to think about. I hadn't considered that. Even if the person doesn't seem perfect, maybe they'll be more appealing over time.",Maybe try a date that is casual and no pressure.
"Like a lunch date? Or coffee? Maybe without the pressure, it'll be possible to ease into a relationship.",A lunch date or coffee sounds perfect.
"Ok. I'll try that. The next gal that I like, I'll ask her to coffee. We'll see where it goes from there.",That sounds like a great idea.
Thanks for the suggestions. You've really helped me get a better perspective on this whole thing.,You're welcome. I'm glad to hear that.
Hello.,"Hello, how are you at the moment? My name is Jo"
I am doing okay I suppose.. How are you??,I am not so bad. Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about today?
Yes. I had to throw out my sister the other day and Im kind of upset over it.,"I am sorry to hear that. What precipitated that, had you been having problems for a while?"
"She was in a psych ward for a while and when it was time to discharge her, my mother didnt want her back. She was going to send her to a foster home so I volunteered to take her in. Since then, she has stopped taking her medication and is acting out.","Ah, so you feel as though your mother could and should have helped and you were put into an impossible position you were not prepared for?"
Pretty much.,I can sympathise with you having siblings with extreme mental health problems - I have been there too and I know how difficult it is.
"I tried to have my mother take her back, but she still didnt want her there. So I sent her to my grandmothers and she turned that side of the family against me.","Mentally ill people can unfortunately sometimes be manipulative, though they do not mean it. Have you had any contact with her since?"
Only once and she was just telling me that I was a horrible person. This all started over her stopping her meds and then I asked her to clean her room.,That sounds very toxic. Is it possible to persuade her to seek medical help? I realise she might be reluctant to
"We have tried to get her into therapy again. But, COVID put a block on that. I suggested that she go back to the ward and maybe be placed into a group home.","Ah yes, it is a terrible time at the moment isn't it? I think a lot of people are not getting the medical help that they need because of the virus Please do not beat yourself up over this - it does sound as though you have done absolutely everything you could to help."
"I would hate to see that happen, but Im at my wits end.",I can tell that you feel really bad about this just from your tone of voice. Please remember that you can't fix everything in the world.
"Now my dads side of the family hates me because they say Im ""mean to her"". All I asked her to do was to clean her room and maybe socialize every once in a while. Im more mad than sad.",Socialising can be hard for people with mental health problems. It might have been best if you did not press her too hard to do that though I know you did not realise.
"I understand, but I think it would have better than sitting in a dark room all day.",Does she suffer from depression also? That might account for her trying to shut herself away
"Yes, but she denies it whole heartedly. This is why she was taking medication.",I understand that it can be very difficult to make people take medication if they refuse to recognise that they have a problem.
I just wish she could she what I see...,Unfortunately that is not likely to be possible. All you can do is be kind to yourself and know that you really did try to help her
I was afraid she was going to ruin my family with her attitudes.,I hope that I have been able to help a little. I really appreciate that you felt that you could open up to me
Thank you. I feel better being able to rant to someone.,You're welcome. Have a lovely festive season! I feel that all will be better in the coming year. You need to press quit from your end and take the survey :)
hi help to solve my problem,How are you today?
fine. What about you?,What is bothering you today that I may be able to help with.
my close friend made a mistake. she scolded for it and not speak to me at all,Maybe she misunderstood what you meant?
I told her not to make a mistake and advised her. but she refused it and scolded me Also she behaved that as if I commited a mistake,Maybe you were too direct with your answer and she could not process the impact.
I just helped her only but she refused me and hurt me,"All people cannot be helped directly, maybe a subtle lead would have helped."
"No, I will tell all the facts about it. but she cant believe me and hurt me more and it make me more emotion ok. I will try to recover from this situationm",Why did she feel so repulsed by your answer?
"Since she is close friend for more than20years, I cant tolerate it because she didn't accept her mistake I tend to rectify her mistake but she didn';t accept my voices at all",Long term friendships are difficult to unravel from misunderstandings.
"yes, i think so how to solve this misunderstading",Maybe you can try again with a more indirect approach.
"With full of depression, I can't do what to do If approached indirectly, it will be helpful to resolve this probleem I just follow it","There is no reason for you to be depressed, the friendship is of value to you"
Too Much Work Pressure,I understand... What kind of work do you do?
Administration Work,I understand that. How else are You
I am female and feminism problems also there during that time i am getting very anger,I am Jason by the way... How am I speaking with?
U r good What type of work u r doing What about me ?,Well I am male although I understand having issues everyday. Are things slow at your work?
Sure as a working people everyday issue will be there ... i am right My work is Slow ?,How are you feeling right now?
"Not so bad , but Ok",Well what's going on with your work? What's causing so much pressure in your life?
Too much administrative work like preparing reports for various departments and send mail to clients There is no proper communication from top level people so happening error That time i am getting angry,"I can understand that, kind of makes you feel mistrustful?"
"Yes, you are correct , So i home i like to listen some good music to reduce my tension DO like music? What type of music do u like",I love music
"Great Me Too , really awesome",I honestly listen to mostly rap... lol what about you? What do you like? Although I pretty much listen to anything. Second in line is Country lol
"i like instrumental music , like mild guitar and some other",What is your favorite instrument?
Piano and Guitar,"I love piano, my favorite anyway... Do you play?"
"Some times i like to here some Indian instrument also No, i will not but i like to listen Sorry i will not play , but i like to listen Do u know to play?","I understand that. I tried to play once, but it was difficult. Variety is the spice of life."
Yes you are correct me too tried one time but i can't,"I got further with piano than guitar, but that still wasn't far. I tick with just listening now."
That is great pleasure to be,I do enjoy it. I listen to music while I do everything. I run every morning as well so music is great. The running helps to relieve stress. What other hobbies do you have?
I am other hobbies is take care of my kid... She is an angle to me.. i love her lot and she is great to me,I understand that. They definitely bring joy into our lives. Do you just have one?

Thank U,What work is that?
Bye Have a Good Day Some Report preparation,Have an amazing Christmas!
Hi there i am worried about my job as my company is restructuring atm,I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling about that?
really worried and anxious like i dont want to get up in the morning,I hear you feel worried and sad. It must be hard
everyone is fighting and trying to get the good jobs,That sounds very stressful. What is something you can do to get through your work day?
i guess i just want reassurance that i will have a job still after christmas i am worried as i have a family and money is tight,"I understand, I have faced similar circumstances. What can you do to prepare for a change one way or another?"
i guess i could look for another job,Could you look at jobs you think you would like even more?
or maybe learn a new skill i really like my current job tho i like the people who i work for and work with,Perhaps it is a chance to gain new experiences or find an even better company!
i guess so but there are not may other companies where i lkive live,Sometimes for me I have to change how I look at the situation.
such as?,"When I think something is all bad, I have to look for the positive. I look at it as maybe you will find a great company that values it's employee's but you won't know unless you try."
i cant see much positive as i like the job and the company and dont want to leave,That seems like a hard situation. It must be difficult.
Hi.,"Hi, how are you?"
"Doing okay, thanks, how are you doing?","I am doing all right, thanks. Anything you would like to talk about?"
"Yes, my fiance and I are splitting up.",I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been together?
A little over 5 years.,"Wow, that is a long time. Breaking up is never easy, but it's especially rough when you were in a long term relationship."
"Yes exactly, so I feel like I'm starting all over again.","I know how that feels. It's really hard at first, but it gets easier. There are some benefits to being single after all."
"Sure, I will have time to focus on myself and start anew. But, I am nervous and apprehensive.","It might help to look for a new hobby. That will give you something to focus on, and it could help you meet new people too. My main hobby is baking."
This is true. I have wanted to start going to the gym more and start doing more yoga.,I think that's a great idea. Exercise is good for the body and mind. :)
Thank you. I also need to start looking for a new apartment. I am staying with a friend for now.,Looking for a new place can be a hassle! But it is kind of exciting too. I think i t's nice to move into a fresh new space and experience a change of scenery.
"It's been hard with the pandemic, but luckily I have a good friend and she's not rushing me out.","Yeah, unfortunately the pandemic has made a lot of things harder :("
"Yes, I feel like it had an impact on my relationship.",A lot of my friends have been saying the same thing. It seems like everyone has been under so much stress lately.
Hello. I am so upset. It's ridiculous how things keep happening to people around me. I suppose my supporter is not here.,hello how may I assist you today?
I am just so upset It's like things never get better,I am sorry to hear that. I know how you feel.
Yeah... My mom is in Mexico right now for some ex who got deported. Like come on. It's bad enough she sent money to him.,What have you tried in the past to turn things around?
Hm. I tried moving on. And it just appears she gets worst,So you are missing your mom?
Not really... She just keeps asking me for mone I gave her like 10k for the house she bought and she hasn't done anything back.,Oh I see my mom has also done this in the past. Sometimes I wonder who raised who?
Yeah. I get that She rented it to some guy and left before even getting some decent money so now she is stranded in Mexico with some guy who can't even afford to get her back,That is the worst. I ended up having to cut my mom out of my life.
I wonder if I should do the same... My grand mother basically gave me a whole speech about how ashamed she is.,Sometimes it is for the best to set clear boundries.
But who knows. Apparently my mom said she'll put the house in my name for all these things I did for her. Kind of annoying to be frank.,Is Grand mother ashamed of you or her daughter? I feel it should be her ashamed of her daughter.
My grand mother is ashamed of her daughter I am kind of left with a weird circumstance.,At least that is a good thing to come out of a bad situation.
Only reason she has a house is because I helped. And if I leave it. Everyone in my family said I would be irresponsible to let my mom lose it.,I do not think that would have a reflection on you. It should only reflect on your mom.
"Yeah, they said they already know my mother is irresponsible. Instead they suggested I should provide extra financial security to myself or at least some future children. Grandma already is giving a home and 2 apartments but... I guess I am the only kid. Christ. My mom lost my om over 100k to be honest. It was crazy growing up to that",It may be nice to have a bonus house for the future. But even that comes with headaches. In the end you have to do what is best for you.
Yeah. I guess boundaries are good. I left her without much help to be honest but I guess just hearing it frustrates the crap out of me.,Or sell it now and pocket the money to recoup what was lost.
I would but it isn't even my property And mom needs a place to stay... sometimes I wonder if she just wants to be homeless,So she is just talking circles and not accomplishing what she says?
More like she keeps talking about doing something crazy like have a police chase and how she doesn't care for anything,"Some people do choose that life to be free of responsibility. Have you had a talk with her about seeing a mental health professional, She may be having some issues that would benefit from care."
I tried to baker act her after she tried to call the cops on me randomly It ended up them asking dumb questions like if she knows what day it is letting her free somehow ending up with her getting herself hospitalized 2 weeks later for low hemoglobin.,"Often police officers are not fully trained in helping mentally ill people, they only access if the person is a danger to themselves or others."
yeah it sucks Tried to get her on disability but they just denied her She was brought up with bipolar depression before I was born. She said she just ran out the hospital.. I don't know how she is just getting the consequences of that now,A good first step is taking her to your local mental health provider. Or ask at a major emergency room where this is located as sometimes the places are hard to find.
That was about 30 years ago Crazy they didn't stop her Well I do feel better. Thinking about boundaries. It has been less stressful being so involved.,Without treatment she may just be getting worse. That is good to hear..
I've heard she has a lawyer trying to straighten up the whole disability and tr eatment thing My girlfriend just won't let me stay out of it Saying my mom has no one and I would regret it if she just does something crazy,That does make it difficult when a partner encourages you to engage in unhealthy behavior.
Yeah. If it was up to me I would probably just be dead silent,I suggest talking to your girlfriend about how it makes you feel when she insists you continue a relationship that causes so much pain.
Yeah. That's a good point. Well I think the point about boundaries really stuck with me I feel so much better now,It was nice talking to you.
Hello. I'm looking for some help.,Good Morning! would you like to tell me whats going on?
I have a big test coming up for a college class and I am very anxious about it.,you seem really concerned about a big test coming up and its making you feel anxious. is that correct?
Yeah exactly. I feel like my future depends on getting a good grade on this test.,"just from chatting with you, I can feel how anxious you are."
I've been studying every day for weeks but I still can't help but feel really anxious. I don't know what to do. It's messing with my sleep schedule.,your doing your best and continuing to try hard! it's great that you are working so hard to pass this test.
I'm trying my best I'm just worried it won't be enough.,deep breaths can help people calm down. Can you try and take a few deep breaths?
"Yes, I can try to do that more often.",how confidant do you feel with the material?
I'm fairly certain I have most of it memorized but what happens if I freeze up and forget during the test?,I feel the same way when I am taking a big exam! Try to remember to breath and not be so anxious that will only cause you to forget everything you studied. You seem very intelligent and I know you can do this!
Thank you! Do you think taking a practice exam would help?,yes I think a practice exam would be a great way to put you at ease and help you work on anything you might need to freshen up on.
"Ok, I will try that out. I appreciate talking to you I feel better already.",it was very nice speaking with you today. Good luck! remember deep breaths and I know you'll be just fine.
Hi,"Hello, how are you today"
I am okay but started reflecting on the past and started to feel angry,I see. Sometimes that can happen when you look back on yourself. What is making you angry about the past?
I am angry I trusted my ex partner. They cheated on me and tried to hide it for months.,I can personally relate to that myself. I have went through something similar like that 4 years ago. It can be very frustrating when it happens.
What do you do when you are reminded of that situation or think about the person?,The easiest thing that I did in my situation was obtained a new hobby. I took my anger out on my ex by joining Crossfit and interacted with that community. It helped me take my mind of from my ex.
I've seen that Crossfit helps a lot of people. That is a good idea but it is kind of intimidating,"Crossfit may not be for everyone, but do you think a new hobby may help you? Have you taken one in recently?"
I have recently started painting and it is very relaxing,Painting is an excellent hobby. I can see that it's relaxing as well as help put your emotions into something physical.
Yes. I usually do it while listening to podcasts. It is a great distraction,"It sounds like that you are doing great with your hobby. Have you try to interact with anyone else, such as an art community or your friends on your feedback?"
I have but not many of my friends have been in the position I was or understand how I feel,"Yea, I can see why that may make you feel alone in that aspect. I thought about that myself, but there are groups that can help you out. Strangers in fact. I went on Reddit to express my frustrations and it can help to just let out your anger."
Personally I've heard that Reddit can be really toxic,"It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy. It is kind of like what we are doing right now to be honest. Again, it is not for everyone, but it does offer a group to talk to during this pandemic lol."
I guess I can at least try it. Thanks for all the great advice,Only if you think it will help. Do you think it will?
I think it might be at least comforting knowing people have the same experience.,"No problem. I really hope that I was able to help you at least. I am still available if you want to discuss further. Like I said, I know how it feels because my ex hid from me 2 years that she was seeing someone else, so I can relate with you."
"This was very helpful, thanks again. You can end the conversation. Bye",Have a good day :)
Hello? I'm so emotionally exhausted all the time lately.,Hi. It sounds like your having a hard time. Is the stuff going on that could be contributing to this?
With Covid going on and school being from home my house is so chaotic all day and I can never get any peace. I feel like I'm always going and never stop,My own kid has been home through all this too so I understand.
There is always something going on and I miss quite and chances to just relax without having to tend to someone else all the time,Have you tried to talk to your spouse and see if you can have some you time? Maybe have them take the kids out so you can rest.
I feel so guilty doing that though. Like what is the point when I know when he leaves I'll feel horrible and then end up like cleaning the whole house or something.,I used to be like that too until i found a hobby I enjoyed so I could have something just for me.
I used to love doing art things but I haven't done anything in a few years. I do miss it what are some things your like to do?,I think you should try to get back into that. maybe it will help your find yourself a little bit more again. I like to get out and hike. I also really enjoy painting for fun
I think I might do that. Thank you for making me think to do something i have let fall by the wayside. I love being outdoors. My husband works a lot so we can only really get out one or twice a week because we only have one care and i think being stuck inside all the time is really what is causing my feelings.,It sounds like you have a lot going on at home and with the way of the world right now I think your are trying your hardest.
Thank you so much. It is nice to hear some support.,It sounds like your stressed a lot and just having a little trouble finding your way forward. They say getting outside and getting sun helps with your mood and demeaner. Have your tried just walking around the block a few times a week?
I am. I would love to get outside but some times it hard. I do know that i should try a little harder. Thank you for talking to me,Of course. I am glad i could help. Do you feel like this has helped you?
Hello,"Hello there, how is life for you right now?"
I suppose its Life right now anyways at some point in time I suppose it wont be though,"Well, that sounds vaguely positive but is there something you'd like to talk specifically about?"
sure we could talk about the holidays and friends and all the mess it causes.,"Have you been having some problems with your friends lately? This can be a very stressful time of year, I know."
all of it and I seem so little compared to everyone else like im just walking and wearing a ton of shame around me ya I feel so drowned out by everyone else I feel like I am clothed from head to toe in it,So you are feeling worried deep down about something right now? Would you like to tell me more about ti?
I dunno if its worried so much as feeling so little compared to it. worr worried might not be the right emotion you are really supportive btw 8o))),Do you think that perhaps you feel numb to things that are going on even though you should be worried about them?
No i think i feel dumb but its not numb. one time i went to the dentist and he gave me a shot in my mouth that was numb this is kinda of a prickley feeling its not numbness.. something close but a stutter mayber,"I see - that is interesting, I have never heard of anything like that before. Do you think that there might be some sort of physical problem going on?"
Thank you for clearing it up you are the greatest bestest clairvoyant mturk supporter I have ever met.. Really I mean you have made me see things as they really are. your the first mturk supporter i ever met.. But dont let that discourage you.. you still the best!! merry christmas O nvm it says we have to do this for 15 minutes lol,"Well, erm, thank you and a very Merry Christmas to you too. Yes fifteen minutes :D. Have you thought of making a list of goals for the New Year to motivate yourself?"
Yea I have been smoking cigarettes for to long all bs aside.. Im going really try to get out of the habit of it this year. hopefully get out of where im staying to.. to a bigger place,"I smoke too much too. It costs a lot and it's really bad for my health. I think I am gonna try and quit - again, sigh - in January too"
try not to shame my friends or enemies any. do something good for someone this year I hope to.. try to at least.. hehe i said on my birthday which was the end of november i was quitting i really need try harder and do it,Maybe try saving the money you save on cigarettes for a few months and then treat yourself to something really nice?
ya cigarettes they getting up much a pack they really are a waste of money. especially if you dont have alot of money like me ya Im really going to try total waste of money make you smell bad,Nearly ten pounds a pack here (UK). I am gonna try and save up for a new handbag!
hope you kick it to. ya im in the us they about 8 to 10 dollars here in the usa,Everything is cheaper there than here :D. Do you have any fun plans for Christmas Day?
you can get some generic ones for like 6 bucks a pack.. its questionable if they tobacco though or recycled newspapers i was thinking about hiding everyones christmas presents after they put em under the tree tomorrow night.. but it seems like to much effort and i have stay up after they put em up lol.. other then that nah just going kick it anyhows though I hope you have a really Merry Christmas and your next year goes way awesome,It will be nice to have a couple of stress free days ... assuming that they are stress free!
hehe i got get over my dumbness i mean my numbness that my real new years resolution,"I hope you have a really nice Christmas and New Year too. Let's face it, hopefully 2021 cannot be worse than 2020 (touch wood)"
hehe hopefully if no more covid outbreaks,Anyway thank you for talking and I hope you feel a little better.
im ready get out of my little corner,Hit the button and take the survey ;). I can't end it from my side
Hi. I'm a little stressed out at the moment over losing my job in the coming months.,I'm sorry to hear about that! I can totally understand why you'd be stressed. Is it for certain that you will lose your job?
"The company I work for is winding down. i'm on the old side to be looking for a job and i'm likely going to have to accept a lower salary, a longer commute and a heavier workload. In other words, I have a job I love, close to where I live that is very manageable. I can't sleep and I'm insanely anxious all of the time.","I can feel your anxiety, and I completely understand why you're feeling that way, but you don't know for sure that will be true. Have you started looking for a new job already?"
I started looking for a job last week. I had a transition meeting today to pass on the little bit of my work that will be left to another person. I have 2 children; one who just started college this fall and another who is a junior in high school. my elderly mother lives with me also so I can't sell my house any time soon and move into something smaller and cheaper. I feel really trapped at the moment.,"It definitely sounds like you're being overwhelmed with a lot of responsibilities along with your job loss. It's definitely a lot of things to deal with all at once, but it would help to break things down so they're more manageable. Do you have anyone close by who can help you out?"
i have friends and family close by. i don't like to burden people with my problems. I know i also don't adjust well to change and that doesn't help. breaking issues down into groups is helpful and may take away some of the enormity of everything.,"I understand completely. I used to bottle things up too, but I've learned that the people who love you won't think you're a burden if you ask for help or just to have someone blow off some steam. Changes are definitely scary, but they can also be a great opportunity to do something different. Is there anything you want to try doing?"
I've always been reluctant to ask for help or favors because i keep thinking there will always be a time down the road where i will need something more. it's helpful to have someone remind me that change isn't always a bad thing. thank you. I'll talk to some friends to see if anyone has some good budget cutting tricks. I'll continue to look for a job and i'll try to calm down a little for now.,It sounds like you're very self-aware and I think your friends and family will be very willing to lend a hand.
"i am aware of many things including how truly fortunate i am to have my family, friends and health. I really appreciate your kind words and calming suggestions. thank you again.","Yes, your family, friends, and health are all really important! I hope you stay safe!"
You too.,I hope you get to enjoy the coming holidays with your family and friends!
and you as well.,You're welcome! Have a great day.
Have a great day too!,I hope I was able to help.
My friend thinks we should still be friends but her drug addict boyfriend has already borrowed money from myself and others too many times and has stolen from other people.,"Let me see if I understand you correctly, you no longer want to be friends because her boyfriend is a drug addict and a thief?"
"Yes, I can still care about her but I cannot be a part of her life if this is what she wants.",i can understand and i have had to do the same thing.
"Am I wrong? Sometimes I'm confused by what I'm seeing. Other times, like now, I feel confident in my decision. I guess I never thought I would see her end up with this kind of situation. Hello?","I think you have to do what keeps you safe and healthy. you can tell her you are here for her, but that you will not watch her destroy her life/"
I thought the same thing. I've had family members who were alcoholics and it was almost the same thing. I bailed them out till I saw it wasn't going to make a world of difference.,"so your plan is to keep your distance, your friend will eventually see him for who he is."
How do I deal with the sadness of all this?,I would suggest joining a group like Al-Anon. It will be goof for you to talk to others in this situation.
Maybe so. I know I talk to family about it and they don't think it's that big of a deal.,It is difficult for others to understand unless they are in the situation.
"Yes, I guess it is not easy for them to understand. But she's been my friend for so many years, I just don't get it. What was that group Al-Anon?",I mean Non-Anon -it is a 12 step program for loved ones of addicts. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I'll have to look into it.,okay
"No, I think that's all I needed,maybe just talking about it put things into perspective.","Great, it was nice talking to you."
Nice talking to you too.,Bye
Hi how are you ?,"I'm doing fine , how are you?"
"Doing ok, thanks .",thats good what do you have planned for the holidays?
Not a whole lot due to the economic hardship my family and I are facing How about you ? as far as holiday plans,I completely understand that i feel that pain as well. are you there?
oh I am sorry to hear that,it's ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time
Thats true that should be the holiday spirit and keep hope alive,exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year?
Cook a good meal and spend time with my kids and spouse. Gifts wont be extravagant this year but I guess its the thought that counts,yes it's the thought that counts and being blessed to be around love ones
"Totally, thanks for that insight",I myself is going to enjoy good food and enjoy hopefully some decent winter weather your welcome
"very nice, does it snow where you live ?",no snow here the weather was really nice today high of 60 degrees what about where you are at?
awesome. we are dealing with 60s ourselves which is not too bad either,nice
How was your thanksgiving ? were you able to invite others or was it just with family ? assuming you are in the US somewhere,"Yes in the US , thanksgiving was just with close family members ."
"Hello, how are you?","Hi there, how are you feeling?"
"I'm alright, honestly I'm feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I'm facing is that I've had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I'm only 24 years old. Right now in my life I'm ready to seek help, but I'm having a lot of anxiety about it because I'm very worried about how others will judge me. I'm worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I'm ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I've made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help.",I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk?
"Yes of course I didn't hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I'm not the only one who feels this way I really know that that's what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know",What level of alcohol consumption do you have?
"no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when I actual do it",Trust me everyone will be very sympathetic :). Everyone there will be in the same place And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself
"and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day . And thank you, I really do appreciate your help. I know that and I know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know. Id like to grow up and have a normal life (:",I am not sure how much half a gallon is to you ... I am in the UK and I know it differs between the US and UK :)
"thank you, i do feel better about going now. I just dont know what to expect and it can be scary sometimes",You will be treated with respect at all times. You might even find that you make some new friends :) Ping :)
"You're right, and that's what I probably need also is some friends who are in similar positions",I'd recommend online message boards
"They'd understand my situation more, and be good influences",Anyway I hope I have been able to help and thank you for talking!
"alright, I havent looked into those but thats a good idea. I definitely will tonight. Of course, you really have. I appreciate your advice, it really did help calm my mind about the whole situation. Thank you again (:",Most welcome! Can you press quit first as alas I can't do it from my end till you have
yes of course,just hit the quit button and fill out the survey :) Don't press return tho!
I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills.,I'm sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills.
"There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed.",That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again.
I am trying. I've started looking online for new positions but it is a process.,It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise.
I just still am continually nervous and having a hard time coping.,Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all?
I haven't but maybe that will help me stay calmer.,That can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself.
That makes sense.,"Also, job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers. Have you tried any?"
I haven't but that may be helpful as well.,I sought out help from a recruiter online who helped me to find a job as well. Have you heard of that option or tried it?
That might help me to take the stress off myself and get someone to help in the search.,"Yes, I see that you seemed to be more relieved finding out these options. Would you say these suggestions have been helpful?"
"Yes, I'm starting to feel some of the pressure taken off me.","From what I've seen, people who can use some of these strategies like deep breathing and counseling they have felt some relief and could move forward better toward their goals."
I feel a lot better. Thanks for your support.,You are welcome. Can I help you with anything else?
Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task?,oh no i'm sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem
I'm trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me.,We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs?
No. That's my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me.,Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats?
"I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid-19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I'm trying to work online. I'm trying to stay encouraged.","I understand how you feel, it's tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself"
Thanks. I appreciate that. What do you do to stay encouraged or confident?,I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy. I like to cook since it's very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated
cooking for me is just another chore. But getting outside might help. I live out in the country. So I have nice scenery.,"That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel"
It has been days since I even sat on the porch. And weeks since I took a walk.,you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality
That's a good idea. What sort of projects are you working on? Job? Hobby?,yeah I have a full time job and working on mturk at night. Covid has hit me financially too
Wow. that's a lot.,we all face different pressure and have to find ways around it
Yep. You are right. Thanks for the suggestion to get outside. I'm ging out for a walk tomorrow.,"Please stay positive, go out more and exercise more frequently"
I will. Good luck tonight. Make that money! ;),you too
Good afternoon,Good afternoon
"I lost my job 1 month ago and I can't find a new one, I have fear and anxiety that soon I will have nothing to pay with for my rent. Would you be able to suggest me how to cope with my fear?",I am sadden to hear that. I'm sure if you think positive and try really hard you will find a job and thinking postive will help with your fear and anxiety.
"It's just I feel fear all the time, and now with this pandemic it's really hard to find a job. I have a feelings now that if I fail I have to go back to my country as a loser.","It sounds like the pandemic has caused you to feel fear and have anxiety, is that right?"
"It some sort of way, I lost my job because of it and my girlfriend is not talking to me as well now...",It sounds like you are under a lot of stress and don't have a way to realse that stress.
"Ah could be, what could you suggest me to do?","You can try yoga, or doing activities that cause you to feel relax."
"I can try, but I don't see how it will help me to find a job. I barely can sleep at nights","Getting a lot of rest or releasing stress will improve your fear and anxiety, which will lead to a more positive attitude to finding a job. Having a more postiive attuide well help you find a job."
Do you think interviewers see that I have a fear and anxiety and that's why I don't get a job?,Of course they do. They can sense those emotions and take that into consideration when they are interviewing you.
Oh ok I will try yoga then. If it will not help me what else I can try?,You can try to mediate and not focus on such negative things.
Can I have any medications to intake to easy fear?,"I am sure they have those, but of course you will need a doctor's opinion."
"yeah I will, Thank you so much for today I feel better now.",Your most welcome.
hello,"Hi there, how can I help you?"
I would like some help with the problem I am facing,"OK, sure. Can you tell me what the problem is? I'll do my best to help."
"Well I am going into my next college semester next month, and I am very frightened about a calculus class I have to take. It's an honors course and I am very worried that I will not do well","I can understand that. It must be an important exam for you. Do you enjoy calculus? I'm terrible at anything with numbers, myself!"
"I don't remember, I took an easy calculus course in high school but that was a couple years ago. I only got a B there, so I'm worried about taking an honors one. I have to take it for my degree goal",A B is a great result! Are there any revision courses that you can access to help refresh your skills?
"I don't think so, the campus is closed due to the pandemic. There are a few online tutors but they are almost always busy",This pandemic has really made it difficult to get anything done hasn't it. Do you know of anyone else who is looking to take the course that you got revise together with? I always find it easier to work through things like this with someone else.
"Yes the pandemic has affected many of my friends and their families, very difficult these times are. No, none of my friends are taking the class/ none of them have ever taken calculus","There seem to be some really good online courses out there. It might be worth sending out enquiries to a number of tutors, asking them to get in touch as soon as they are free, and in the meantime working through something online to help build up your confidence?"
That sounds like some good advice to me Maybe I'll try working on it for my confidence like you said,I bet once you get into it again it will all come back to you. Sometimes getting started is the hardest part.
I think you're right! Do you believe in me? That I will pass well?,"I think that if you got a B once, you can do it again, and if you really want it, which you clearly do, you can do anything! Aim for an A, you can do it!"
Thank you very much you've been very helpful God bless you have a good day,"And you too, good luck!"
"Hello, is someone there?","Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today?"
"Hi Jonathan, I'm Keri.",Hi Keri. How are you today?
I'm feeling a little bit down today. I've been feeling a little bit down a lot lately.,Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately?
My ex-husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. They might get married.,"Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two?"
"He started dating a few months after we split up. I don't know if this is the only person he's dated but I think so. He really moved on quick. Hi, are you still there?",Yeah I understand what you're going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he's trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours?
"It makes me feel like he didn't learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he's better than me because he has someone new and I don't. I'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won't ever find anyone.",That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.
"Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male (please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women.","I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I'd say try not to pay any mind to what he's up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass (making yourself happy) then you'll have a much more fulfilling life."
"Haha, watering my own grass. That is a good way to put it. Thank you for talking to me for a few minutes. It makes me feel a little bit better to have someone agree that it is okay to spend time working on me, instead of thinking that it is sad or pathetic or an excuse. I really appreciate it.",Oh absolutely Keri. Thanks for opening up and sharing your experience and feelings with me for just a few minutes. It was great to talk to you.
"Have a good night, Jonathan. :-)",Happy Holidays Keri. Keep your head up!
Hi. How are you?,Good how are you doing?
I’ve had better days.,"Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it?"
I definitely would if you are willing to listen.,I would be willing to do that
I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We dated for two years. Just feeling blue.,Break ups are the worst and feeling blue is totally understandable.
I just need to do things to keep my mind off of it I guess.,Reflection is important but healing and moving on which will take a little time is also important :-).
You are so right. Any ideas on what I should do?,Yes distraction is really good like taking up a new interest or reading a good book something like that. Any friends you can hang out with?
I love reading. I might do just that. I have friends but with this pandemic it is hard to get together with them.,Yes this pandemic has really been hard on social interaction and a good book you can be great distraction.
I will do that. I might try some yoga.,I am a Yogi Bear too and that is great for relaxation we did the angry dog and we barked lol in class yesterday We meet outside in the park even finding a remote space in a park might do some good you never know
Lol. That is awesome. I already feel calm!,Perfect :-)
How long you been doing yoga?,About 10 years I need it and it really does help ease the stress for me
I'm so worried about my child who has so much homework and despite studying all night still is struggling.,Hello! How are you feeling today?
I'm a bit worried today and nervous.,"You are a very good parent to care and worry. I get it, I am a mom myself! Is your child doing digital learning or in person?"
It's actual a hybrid which is challenging. 2 days in school and 3 days at home.,I can see how that is challenging Is it the same teacher for both?
She has about 9 teachers and it's only 6th grade.,That has to be really frusterating not having just one teacher you can go to in order to see if there is anyway to help your child not struggle
"I want to push her to keep working, but also want to give her a break from all the work. There is so much homework for a little child.",Perhaps you can find out which classes your child struggles with and contact the teacher(s) or school to set up a conference? I know some schools even have peer tutors they say help pair students with!
I'm thinking about tutoring possibly but being home and going to school it is so overwhelming already and to add tutoring to the list is another question for me.,My children are five and eight. My eight year old spent about ten hours doing digital learning the other day when in-perosn was closed. I was so frusterated. I let her pick a movie and snack when she was done to reward her for finishing.
"Yes, we've had some months worth of snacks! Good thing for Burger King!",Have you looked into any edulational or learning games? There is nothing wrong with rewarding your child for doing good in school or getting thier work done! :)
That is a good idea. I wonder if they have one for vocabulary as that is the test tomorrow! She says she loves them. I'll have to look!,"I have done that with my kids. Technology is such a huge part of children's lives these days, they will play a videogame in a heart beat. I don't think they even realize they are learning sometimes!"
I have to do some research though and doing this x 3 kids is draining on top of work,check out the website adventure academy. They have things for all ages/grades!
Thanks so much for all your help! I'm feeling somewhat better and encouraged! Have a good day!,I'm glad I could help! You too!
Actually I have one more question,"okay, what is it?"
Do you think I should feel guilty for making her study?,I think it is natural for a a parent to feel guilty when they are having thier child do something the child doesn't want to do. i think the benefits outweigh the negatives though. i think finding a way to make studying fun could be a win-win. you are a good parent for wanting the best for your child!
Great advice. Thanks again. Take care!,I think there should be more parents out there that care about their children and their children's future like you do. keep up the good work!
Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don't think I can ever be happy again.,I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self-esteem is that true?
I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work.,do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better?
"Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination.",remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren't right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else.
"I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable.","have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn't want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn't mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that."
"I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don't want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don't ever want to feel like this again.","relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves"
"This was the first guy I ever lived with, I thought we would get married one day. How do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts.",Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?
"I have a couple acquaintances at work but I wouldn't want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have a good cry but I almost couldn't stop once I started. He was my best friend and who I talked to once we got together I didn't seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. That is why I am here for support.","Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing."
Have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? Does the aching inside ever get better? How long will it take?,"When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it's better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn't stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy."
I am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end. You have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married. I do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. He said if I ever needed someone to talk to he was there. I thought he was just being nice. Maybe I should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere.,"I think that that would be a good idea! for info, In terms of how long it takes to get over it. I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup."
"Thank you for checking on that for me, I hope it is quicker I would hate to feel this way that long. I think I will go see him he is home right now. You have made me feel hopeful and that there will be an end to these feelings and maybe things will go as well for me as they did you. Thank you again.",You are very welcome!
"Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with!",hi what’s on your mind today
My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do.,wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out
Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be.,i'm so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave?
About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on.,not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad
I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more . I feel that everyone must know that I've been dumped and be laughing at me.,you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time
I did not really have any choice though . I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated.,do you know brene brown and her work
"No I do not, who is that?",she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there's a great youtube video on empathy
"Thank you , I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste.","i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn't you in reality the choice they made wasn't about you, it was about them"
It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left.,you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough
I really do not feel like it right now. What was the last fifteen years all about? I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman.,a relationship is part of who you are. it isn't you
But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to.,it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now
But I feel that I am facing middle age on my own and I really do not want to do that.,"you have survived 14 days without a bad relationship. keep on doing that day by day and before you know it, you will be on the other side of the bad feelings"
What happens if I just can't ever get over it though? Right now it's hard to see any sort of way through these feelings.,"yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out"
"I feel I might have missed out on my chance to have a family of my own though, because I waited fifteen years and my partner would not go for that.",please watch the cartoon animals and brene brown on youtube talk about empathy. find one of your friends who has been through the suck and let them help you find your path out.
Most of my friends seem to be very happily coupled up right now. They are sympathetic but they do not really understand.,i had an emergency ovary removal in my early 30s and didn't know if i woudl be able to have children. my doctor told me that the most important thing i could do was to be healthy becuse a healthy mother was what i could give my children even if i adopted them
That sounds like very good advice from both you and your doctor. It is a difficult thing to have to confront though. I really do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to talk honestly with me.,"you want an empathetic friend. nobody has gone through the exact same thing you have but the emotions are common ones. you will be ok, even if you dont feel that way now"
I hope that I will but am not sure. I really do feel rather better about things now though but - there's a long way to go. Thank you so much for your support!,stay strong and stay safe
"Hi, my work situation is stressful","Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. What's been happening?"
They barely acknowledge my presence and don't really talk to me except for an occasional hello,That's not very fair. You deserve to feel valued at your workplace and it sounds like you don't feel that way.
"I know, I don't know why they act this way. is it something I have done. I'm stressed.",You haven't done anything wrong. I have felt that way at work before too. I went to therapy to deal with my difficult work situation.
"therapy, is it maybe me, or should I bring it up with my boss.",You could bring it up with your boss. That would be a very brave thing to do.
I am worried that he would bring it up to my coworkers and I'd feel left in the open. I don't know the best course of action.,"Usually, bosses are required to keep those sorts of things confidential. You could request to speak to someone in Humane Resources, who is trained to help workers."
"I might just do that, although I am worried about escalating above my boss and above my coworkers. Maybe it may best to speak to my coworkers,","You could speak to your coworkers and let them know that you would like a friendlier, more open work environment. Do you think that might help?"
"It might, I don't know what set them off in the first place.",That might be a good place to start when it comes to approaching them. Let them know your side of the situation and maybe they will understand.
I think I will. Would you recommend me buying coffee and doughnuts?,I think buying coffee and doughnuts sounds like a wonderful idea. It seems like you are really willing to help create a healthier work environment.
yeah for my sanity. Thank you,Of course. It's been nice to speak with you. I hope everything goes well for you.
"Thank you, goodnight",Goodnight to you as well!
Hello. Maybe you can help me calm down. I just found out that I'm losing my job in January. (1),Hello! I hope I can. I am so sorry to hear that. That's so rough. There are so many people going through this right now.
Yes and that worries me even more. More people competing for the same jobs. (2),That's a fare worry but you can't be discourged. YOu need to think positively. You can use this as a time to reconnect with family and to get your resume together.
I will have to do a new resume definitely. It's been awhile. (3),That's a good activity !! Do you have anyone who can help you with it?
"I'll have to think on that, I have a friend that might be able to help but it's been awhile for both of us (4)",Do you have any hobbies you can work on while you're home?
"Well I don't think they are hobbies, but there are things that need to be done around the house. Guess I can keep myself busy at least (5)",That's really helpfuL! staying busy is good. It's also really good time to reconnect with a loved ones and friends. You can try virtual connections.
"Yes, but I know I'll also have a lot of work to do to get ready to find a new job. I'm really hoping I can find one before I lose this one (6)",HAve you been searching online sites? They post so many nowadays! If you spend a few hours a day. i'm sure that you'll find one in no time!!
I looked at indeed and I did apply to one thing. But when it came back to me it said that 4970 other people had applied for the same job! (7),"That happens but keep looking. It's a numbers game, so you have to just apply to a ton them once your resume is ready."
I wish I knew how to make myself stand out more. So many people are out there looking for work. (8),"There are online career counselors or resume helpers, they can help you figure out how to make your resume stand out. What industry are you in?"
I'm an accountant (9),"So you're smart! You will defintiely find a job, i have total faith in you."
"Well, with numbers at least! I just worry about companies that aren't able to be open, well they won't need an accountant. (10)","I think with the vaccine coming, things will be going back to normal soon enough! They already started giving the vaccine out."
"I know she would want me to be happy, but i don't feel joy anymore",I understand. Sometimes it's hard to find joy. When do you think you starting feeling this way?
Almost 2 years ago. I'm so lonely without her,"Sometimes, finding joy can be difficult. Especially when what we always turned to for joy is gone. But we can find comfort in little things. Is there something you have that gives you comfort? Even the smallest thing."
When she was alive I felt like she was keeping me alive because i didn't want to put her through the pain of killing myself I feel good for a few minutes at a time but then it all seems pointless,I believe we all have purpose in this life. I know that it's hard to live with-out the ones we hold dearly. I think a way we can keep them alive in our hearts is to pass on the good things about they did for us to others.
You hit the nail on the head. I struggle to find purpose for my life. I have no kids & my anxiety keeps me from reaching out to people.,"I feel the same way, I get anxious around others as well. Maybe little steps are the best way. Sometimes all someone needs is a smile, even when we can't find our own, we can give one to others."
"Everytime I convince myself to seek professional help I fool myself into believing that this will finally be the time I will be able to fix myself. Of course I haven't yet I admit it has helped to be online & see that so many other people share my ""symptoms""","It's always hard to make that next step, but I believe you're closer than you think."
I hope I hurry up. I feel like i'm wasting precious time I can't imagine ever feeling close enough to someone to call them a friend. I wish i could learn to love my solitude more,"You are not alone and you are right, time is precious, but it's okay to take to to grieve. Grief is a part of healing."
Hello,Hey! How can I help?
So I don't know if you can see the topic of my problem like I can see on my screen? If not I'll explain,Yes please do
"So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was ""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend."" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.","Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you Give her time to cool down"
"Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.","You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that"
Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?,"If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place And no because this will make her more angry If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time"
"I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?","But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help"
But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : ),"Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place"
"Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting.","Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)"
Aw thank you! You have a good one.,You too!
I should add (although it doesn't matter). I'm female married to a female.,Hi there! I'm glad you're here
hi,So you're a female and you're married to a female? There's nothing wrong with that at all!
Yes....well we are not living together now. We have to file papers for divorce,I see. So you're actually legally married - didn't just have a commitment ceremony?
Yes legally married,Care to share what led up to filing for divorce?
She cheated. And as far as I know is still with the person,I can certainly understand how that feels. I have been in your EXACT situation.
It's horrible and hard to move on for sure,How long were you with her?
Don't laugh Our one year wedding anniversary was this past Sat. Which I know I shouldnt be so miserable but I am. I think because like some people have told me we were still in our honeymoon stage. We were not fighting or having big issues....she just cheated,"I'm so incredibly sorry to hear that. You realize this behavior, these choices, are a flaw within her, and not you?"
It's hard to see that. I feel like a failure and not good enough Like why even get married in the first place if you are just going to cheat,I can completely understand that as well. I blamed myself for quite some time as well.
Ya you wish you could go back in time and change things or never get married lol,"When you go to bed at night, if you can drift off to dream with a clear conscience, then you're doing significantly better than her! What are you doing to take care of you during this time?"
"Not much at all I feel like I'm in a funk and can't get out of it. My house is a disaster. I have a small business I am not in the mood to work on....I""ve been slacking in everything",You are important! You matter! Why not do something that is relaxing to you?
I do need to do something,Do you have any post-it notes? Or paper and scotch tape?
I do,"Here's what I've done for myself, and other folks that are close to me, going through struggles..."
ok,"Jot down inspirational messages and hang them up on the bathroom mirror, refrigerator, car, etc. ""You matter"", ""You deserve the best"", ""You are the shiznit"", etc"
the shiznet lol I will try that I need to do something,"Then, for the tasks that might be getting a bit behind, make a list, in order of importance -- and include a little reward for each task completed."
Thats a good idea,"We have to take care of ourselves. After doing it for awhile, it just might become second nature to ya. And -- if continued, will show gals in the future exactly how you expect to be treated because they'll see you taking care of you (and not settling for nor accepting any doodie)"
"I know I keep telling myself if I get my act together (physically, financially, etc) that I would attract better people....the kind I want to be with","Whether you ""have your act together"" or not, it's up to you to determine who is worthy of being an active part of your life."
Hi :),"Hiya! =) How are you doing, today?"
"I'm feeling really stressed about university, to be honest. I'm really struggling to find motivation to complete my assignments And it's stressing me out how little work I've completed even though deadlines are coming up.",I totally understand that. Which year are you in?
"I'm in my final year, having to juggle my dissertation with what feels like a million other assignments","Oh goodness, I can't imagine how stressful that would be. I've only gotten my associates, and I found that last semester to be a slough. But what kept me going was the relief and joy I would feel once I had that diploma in hand. Are there any study groups or classmates you can get together with, and basically make a night of it?"
"I don't really have any friends on the course, I'm pretty shy and don't really feel comfortable talking to anyone. I kinda promised myself to make more friends in my final year, but obviously circumstances have changed :/","Very true, this year made everyone's expectations and plans go out the window lol It might be time to put yourself out of your comfort zone, but start small. Are there any clubs or groups associated with your major? That way, you have some common ground to work with."
"I'm honestly not sure, I guess I've always been too nervous to reach out to anyone. I'll have to have a look.","That sounds like a good idea =) Even if you can't hold club meetings on campus or have any gatherings, maybe they hold their meetings over video calls. One plus side to that, is that you don't need to have your camera on to participate."
"That's true. I also feel a bit nervous about my final grades, I've done well so far but just feel like this year might mess everything up.","That's understandable, especially with how the past year has been. Everyone is on edge and everything feels so uncertain, but that's okay, because you're not alone =) You said you're doing well so far? Take pride in that, and focus on that. ""If I've been doing well so far, I must be doing something right. I'll just keep doing what I have been, and everything should work out in the end."""
"Yeah, I am really proud of what I've done so far but it just makes me worry that I won't meet my own expectations","We can be our own worst critics, and that's never been truer than when we're facing a challenge. Self-doubt can be such a pain, but when I find I'm having trouble believing in myself and working toward my goals, I'll focus on what I already accomplished, and that helps give me that extra push to keep going I might be an internet stranger, but I'm proud of you, too. =) You've got one and a half semesters to go! You've got this! I believe in you! <3"
"Thank you, it's actually made me feel a lot better! :)","You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help =)"
Hello,Hello how are you feeling today?
Well. Not so good i just broke up with my girlfriend and she is packing her stuff to leave How are you doing?,I am very sorry to hear that. Breakups can be rough. I'm great! Thanks for asking. Was this a mutual agreement?
Well technically it was a mutual agreement but i feel like I dont want this to happen So what are you up to? Hello? Are you there?,Was there a reasoning behind your decision? Sometimes we let our anger and emotions make our decisions for us.
Well. Basically all started for jealousy and she saw a couple of text messages of my best friend and she misunderstood the conversation and since then its not the same. She doesnt trust me,I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with.
I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work So it got to the point that nothing was the same So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out,How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment. I know this might be so tough for you but l want you to know that you are never alone and you can do this. Maybe read a new book or pick up a new hobby for the time being.
We were together for two years Im trying my best to go through this I hope so. Thanks for all those words It really helps,You're doing the right thing by talking to someone about it. We are not meant to be alone in our thoughts because it can be a scary thing. Bottling up emotions is also never good so for you to reach out is very good and the first step to maybe feeling a little better. I've been in your same shoes and trust me it doesn't feel good so just know I am here for you and you can talk to me in confidence.
Well thank so much. You really help me a lot with every single word Well i have to go. Ill talk to you later,Absolutely! You have an amazing day and keep you head up!
"Hello, how are you?",Hi there! How may I support you?
"Well, I'm really upset with my friends.",I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen?
"Yes, they aren't taking COVID seriously.","Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn't taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns?"
"Yes but they get angry with me. I don't know how to get through to them,",Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It's also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right.
I really don't know I just haven't been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It's a weird dynamic.,"It sounds like you're finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it's the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right?"
That's exactly right.,that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance.
I'd like to think so but I wish they would too. It's hard to know what is right.,"I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try?"
"Yes, but they'll have their BBQs and parties anyway. They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. My husband and I feel bad that we aren't going, but we also know it isn't smart.","I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can't live your life in fear, and that they're going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware."
"We feel like after this is all over, they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time. And I agree. The longer we put it off and don't take it seriously, the longer it will last.","Can you tell them that that just isn't the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don't want to see your pals and family! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you."
Yes that's totally accurate. Yes they are. They are good people. They just think living for the moment is the bigger picture.,I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you're not seeing them.
I think they do. They just think that this is a hoax.,"I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn't think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking."
That's scary. Yeah I don't think they get it.,I am proud of the choices you are making and I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control. There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled.
Thank you. I hope it gets better. But anyway thank you for giving me the chance to open up.,"Yes of course, I hope this was helpful. You are doing the best you can and take pride in knowing that. :)"
I appreciate your willingness to listen and offer support. Life just is so hard right now,"Hi, How are you feeling right now?"
pretty crappy. Just lying in bed. never got out of my pjs today.,Today must have been a hard day for you. It seems that there are some things that are really bothering you.
The problem is I just don't really know how to feel better. I have much to be thankful for but don't seem to be able to really enjoy anything.,I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes even for a person like myself I try to find things that I love to do to keep motivated. Do you have hobbies or things that you like to do for fun?
"That's what my husband keeps saying, too, but I just can't dredge up any enthusiasm for anything except I try to get out and walk because the fresh air is nice. I also knit, which is what I've been doing while lying in bed. But I can't think of the last time I really truly enjoyed myself.","Yes, those are things that does make you day feel good fresh air, and knitting keeps you calm. Also, Have you tried buying a treat for yourself or going out for trip in the previous months to get some relaxation?"
"Yes, the idea of a trip is enticing to me and I really hope to go visit my aunt in Michigan, perhaps in April. She is my mom's only sister and the only relative I have left from that generation and I love spending time with her. That was a good suggestion and I'll try to look forward to that.","Yes, trips are amazing and especially when you visit someone you love spending time with makes even more worthwhile. Time that you get to spend with enjoying yourself and relaxing is something that needs to happen often so we can get back in the fight to be confident or strong to face our daily challenges."
"You have good insight and you are right, I need to focus more on enjoying the time I have with the people that I love. I'm also hoping some new meds will eventually help Thank you for listening God's blessings to you and your family","Thank you and you are so welcome. I am glad I could help you. I hope that you have a wonderful time on your trip when you get to go. Also, I hope that many blessings come to you and your family as well."
Do you have a background in counseling?,"Actually I do not have any background counseling, but I have been through a lot on my own. I have learn to enjoy life no matter what with those that I love and enjoy myself wholeheartedly."
that's a huge gift. I wish I felt happier more often. I think i I think I would feel better if I had someone to talk to more often but I hate burdening my children or husband with my sadness,Thank you. I believe you will find happiness in yourself. All you can do is take one day at time and learn all different ways to find what makes you happy.
"Yes, one day at a time is my motto! and I know God is with us. Thanks again!","We all go through the sadness, and you are not alone. It just what we do next with after the sadness is gone makes it count."
very true!,Yes this is so true. You are so welcome. God is always with us even when we are not sure he is truly there. He is there and he helps us in many ways.
Hai!,Hello! How is everything going?
"very bad , I felt very depressed because I lost my job How are doing?","I am sad to hear that, could you argument on why this happened and when? I am doing well, thank you"
I am a software developer due to covid-19 I lost my job do you refer me with your friends and collegeues.,"Since you are a software developer, isn't there a possibility for you to work from home? Many companies are offering their employees being able to work remotely I understand your depression, losing a job is not easy, but I am sure that you will get through this"
"I have 3 years of experience , now I m working as a free lancer , earning very low","I have heard of sites like fiver where people work on their own. With enough exposure, you can make a living out of it, and you get to be your own boss!"
Yes its good but not much earnings.,"I used to do art on fiver. Yes, you are right, it is not a lot, but hey, we have to start somewhere! If anything, you can always try and look for new job opportunities. I am sure you will see some amazing results with your 3 years of experience!"
"I used to works as software developer , apart from job what are your hobbies?",I like playing videogames and doing art. I find those activities to be relaxing.
"I am very bored to seek job , but I applied in many job seeking websites , Are you diagnosed by COVID-19 , what are the techniques you used to cope the current situation.","I would suggest to wait some time, maybe one of them will call you back! And no, I have not been diagnosed with covid. I try to remain positive and remind myself that a vaccine will be developed soon."
"Thanks a lot buddy, I never expect from u , god bless you! I won't believe the vaccination is the effective measure .",It has been a pleasure!
Vaccination creates many side effect,"I agree, but don't you think those are worth given that you might gain covid 19 immunity? I personally plan on getting myself vaccinated as soon as I can"
are you believing our government too bad..,"That comes down to personal opinion, and is important that we respect each other choices Is there any other concern that I might help you with today?"
Do you like movies?,"Sometimes, as a way to distract myself yes"
I love to watch movies horror movies.,"If it helps you to get distracted and provides you with joy, absolutely!"
Do you smoke and drink alcohol?,"No, I don't find that to be healthy, and I don't enjoy them."
"My alcohol consumption is increased I can't cope myself from this depression , Sure I will leave it",Relying on alcohol or any other addictions as a mean to cope with our problems is a bad idea. Make sure you don't abuse it's consumption. Do you have anyone you can talk to about it? Like a close friend or a family member?
Thank you very much,"You are very welcome, talk to someone if you need to!"
please finish the conversation would you?,You are the one that needs to do it!
I have asked many question you just replied questions so please close the conversation,"If you read the instructions, you will see that you have to hit the ""quit"" button and answer a survey about my performance. I can not end the conversation, only the support seeker can. I am doing my job."
hello anybody home?,Hello! What would you like to talk about today?
"Hi, a little bit of anxiety of academics",Can you tell me more about this anxiety?
"Well, I am nervous about a test I have coming up because I am wondering if I learned enough. ok?","I am here, it seems that you don't feel like you've studied enough. Is that correct?"
"That and because of the pandemic, I have not been able to connect with the teacher enough to know if I am completing things correctly. What can I do?",It truly depends on the subject! There are online sites that provide free additional instruction Can you tell me what the class is?
"Its a math class. I have tried connecting with other students but many are just as confused as me, especially when it comes to showing the work part. You mentioned online sites, how accurate and helpful are those?",Khan Academy is absolutely fantastic! It is extremely helpful and accurate since it is run by educators.
"Ok, I have to check that out as I have never heard of them. Did they have any reviews on how helpful they are in the math field?",No but I am a former math teacher and I would give them to my students!
"Okay, that is great. That eases my anxiety a bit.",I am so glad! I know online school is stressful but I think you can do it.
Thanks. I am learning as I go and I am believe I am getting better. Just got to get use to it.,I can recommend other resources if you'd like.
"Thank you, just a couple more if you have them.","If this is an upper level math course, you can go to university sites! They always have lessons"
"Okay, I will check that out. Thanks for your help.",Of course! Did you have any other questions?
"No, that was all. Thank you for your assistance and providing me with some sources that can definitely help. Have a great day!!",Good luck studying! You're capable of doing well!
Thanks again for the words of encouragement. Goodbye!,You can terminate the convo at any time!
Hello,Hello. How are you doing today?
I have had better days.,Would you like to talk about it?
I could use someone to talk to.,I would love to listen. Where would you like to start?
I’ve been feeling down since I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years.,I'm so sorry to hear that. Breakups are never an easy thing. I've also gone through those and they can make you feel awful.
I’m just trying to pick up the pieces and look to be positive.,That's an excellent place to start. It's hard but I believe that you can do it. Do you have any family or friends that you've been speaking to about this?
Thanks for the encouragement. That means a lot. Any suggestions on how I can get my mind off of it?,Do you have any hobbies? I found that refocusing my energy into something I love doing really helped to bring my mood up.
Great advice. I think I’m going to start up taking yoga again and catch up on some books I’ve been wanting to read.,Yoga is an amazing stress reliever. I practice myself! I like your game plan and I think you'll start feeling the results sooner than you think.
I think I’m going to lay low on dating for a while.,I completely understand. You'll know when you're ready again and it's great to take things at your own pace. All that matters is to do things when you're ready to.
How long do you think I should take a break for?,"Honestly, that will end up being up to you. With my last big breakup, I didn't date for almost a year until I met someone. I would suggest at least a month or so to take some time for yourself and focus on yourself and what makes you happy so when you are ready to date again, you have a stronger sense of self."
Thanks. That is great advice. I wouldn’t want to go into something just for the sake of dating.,Agreed. Taking the breather definitely helps.
Sounds good. I will take your advice.,I'm glad. I really wish you the best and I know that you're going to come through this stronger.
"Hi, I'm very depressed and sad. Please help Please help me I need help",I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know why you feel depressed and sad?
I think it's because of my poor relationships in life,Have you tried taking some deep breaths to help you right now?
I'll try and see if that calms me down.,Tell me more about the poor relationships you have
My family doesn't like me because I'm bad at school. My friends don't really like me or talk to me much. I feel alone.,Are you able to talk to anyone about this? Someone who will at least listen to you talk?
Not really. I try to talk to my friends but they avoid me.,Maybe you could take one person aside by themselves and talk privately about your feeling?
That seems like a good idea.,"Yes, just wait for the right time when the person is alone and ask if you could talk."
"I'll try to do that, thank you.","Remember to take deep breaths, wait for the right time and see if that works for you. I know you can do it."
Thank you so much. I feel like I can talk to someone now.,I have faith in you. Is there anything else we need to talk about?
"No, I'm okay. I feel a little better. I hope I'll be able to talk to a friend soon Sad! Actually I need more help","Remember, the outcome may not be perfect but slowly things will come together. Take it one step at a time."
What step should I take after this one?,See if the conversation gives you some insight on how things could be better. Maybe you could see things from someone else's perspective.
Thank you so much!! You're helping me a ton,Would you be willing to give it a try?
"Yes, of course~","Also, if that works, then build from there. Remain calm and little by little talk about your concerns."
"That seems very, very smart. Thank you Im ok noq now",Get some good sleep the night before you try having the conversation so you are at your best.
"Yes, I promise I will. I'm going to go rest now. Thank you again.",You are welcome.
Hi. How are you?,Can I help you
I'm worried that my job is in jeopardy. I've been really anxious these past few days.,It is actually good. Why you are feeling
"My boss has been talking about money problems at the company. In the past few months, employees have been let go because of budget problems.",So it should not impact you. Don't worry at all.
"I dunno. I think maybe it'll be my turn soon. Other people better than me, who have been there longer have gotten the chop.",You should not listen your co-worker. Just listen your heart. Do your best.
"I have been trying to do my best, but I don't think it's good enough. The company is running out of money because of the pandemic.",Start searching job meanwhile. Don't get panic. You have still lot of time. Be very patience.
I've looked for a job. There doesn't seem to be much out there. Everybody else is looking too! The competition is fierce.,"I can understand. It happened with my sister too. She was also panicking like you, but I told her to apply and give interview. Still it is in process."
I'll keep applying. I've been drinking a lot to deal with my anxiety.,I can assure you don't worry at all. Keep yourself busy with friends. Go out with them and keep yourself busy. You will be fine soon
I'm worried that I'm drinkng too much booze. My friends sit drinking with me and tell me not to worry about work. But I can't stop worrying.,Do meditation or yoga will help you.
Good afternoon. Hope you are surviving he virus,"Hello, I hope you are as well. Is anything the matter?"
I am just looking for a friend to chat with. Just feeling lonely.,I feel the same way. I cant wait for life to be normal again. It has been a hard year.
The virus has stopped people from meeting. What about you? I don't know if life will ever be normal again.,"Do you live alone? Do you mean meeting new people or getting together with people you already know? I am naturally an introvert, so it honestly didnt bother me the first month or so... but I'm so over it now. I wish I had taken advantage of freedoms we had before all of this."
I currently live in a place that is totally lonely. It is not because of the virus but just because people aren't able to reach out or there are no viable places to meet and greet. The freedoms are still there but the fear of getting the virus stops people from normal life.,"I think it will pass eventually, but who knows when. It feels like every where you look things are falling apart sometimes. What kind of place do you live in?"
Currently I live in a hotel getting ready to travel to another state. What about you?,"You're so right.... I miss not fearing the virus. I don't fear at as much as I did, but I fear giving it to a loved one. Do you travel a lot for work?"
"No for personal reasons. I just find the disparity between wearing the mask in some states is not as demanding s others. Here the masks do not seem to be mandatory, but 100 miles and it is necessary.","Some people are on lockdowns, I'm nervous about our income in the next few months with the talk of more stay at home orders. I know it feels like itll be like this forever but I really dont believe it will. It may get worse before it gets better but I think things will go back to normal eventually."
I think we are in a long period of recovery because the country has too many laws in different states that are causing demands on the health system.,"I have traveled states recently and the difference is crazy! I went through Tennessee, missippi, and alabama and stopped a few times.. some places are just going on like normal, hardly any masks.. in arkansas you never see anyone indoors without one."
"Too much politics behand the virus and helping the people. Florida is mandatory, but Georgia is lacks. Tennessee is mandatory but other states are not as caring.",I totally agree. And you never know what is true or not. Its stressful. I'm in georgia now and most people do not wear them unless asked. I've only been required to at dr appointment. Is it mandatory where you are now?
"No except at WalMart Georgia has a high virus rate, yet no mandatory masks.",There are signs here but half the shoppers dont wear them. I think people here dont fear it as much as other places.
"There is no mandatory requirement for the mask, especially at the convenient stores. You walk in and the employees don't even wear them. The screens aren't going to stop the spread.",So you travel because you want to? YES the gas station closest to me.... I have been in there every other day recently and never seen a person in a mask. The employees at the dollar general close to me dont wear them either. I dont think it will either honestly. Sometimes I feel guilty if I'm not wearing one. The uncertainty of everything gets to me.
I wear mine for my own protection. What about you? I have to travel to Virginia soon and I want to arrive clean I am only traveling now because of issues otherwise I would be in FLorida I miss the bneaches,I wear mine to protect other people.... I do have health issues that could complicate things but I dont thing it will stop me from getting it. I MISS THEM TOO. We were in PCB last summer and everyone was freaking about the water lol. we had no idea what was coming
"I understand for protecting others, but when the people around you ignore the virus and refuse a mask, they aren't concerned about you. What part of Florida. I was near Stuart and Jensen Beaches. Masks are mandatory otherwise no entry at the stores","well I hope you are able to connect with people soon.. I think these are cool.. Its nice to talk to new. Youre right generally people dont care for other people, but I'm not that way. Panama City Beach. new people*"
Hello there,"Hi, how are you?"
I am Ok but starting to get a little bit worried about my work situation.,I see. Can you tell me about what's happening with you at work that's bothering you?
I work on projects and have a role for the next couple of months but I will need to look for work and am struggling to find something. I think this is due to covid. I'm afraid I'll lose my house,"It sounds like you're in a tough spot right now, not knowing what your future will be like."
Yeah that's right. It's the uncertainty that's making me fearful.,"Yes, I can sense that you're quite anxious and fearful."
I don't know what to do for the best and how to really get myself out there again.,"I imagine it must be difficult. From a practical standpoint, have you tried to reach out to people you can trust in your personal and professional network to see whether there are opportunities for work?"
That is a really good suggestion I have tried agencies but not actually made a concerted effort with my network. I think I'm in panic mode!,It's understandable that you're feeling a sense of panic now. I imagine everyone would feel that way.
"Yeah true, the news is all soon and gloom and there doesn't appears to be support for those that are still in work. or is there?","Yes, the news can be depressing. Is there a support group of some sort in your area?"
"I haven't checked, I suppose I can find one online. Have you ever used one personally?",I have in the past. It's more common than people think.
I'll give it a try and see if it helps. Thanks for the suggestion. Hopefully with my network I'll find something more permanent in future. I hope!,"I hope you'll find something too. I've found that when you reach out, people can be more willing to help than you expect."
That's great advice. I'll stay positive and keep trying. I suppose many people emails are in a similar position.,"Yes, times are tough for many people."
Thanks for your help. It has been good to talk it through and also thanks for the suggestions.,You're welcome. Happy to help.
"Hi there, how are things?",Hi Can I help you
Yes trying to get over the passing of my aunt a week ago.,You tell me That's so sad. I am sorry!
"Thanks, it is actually a week today. My mother has taken it particularly hard, they were best friends",I can understand very how your mom is going through hard time.
Thanks. I really have not had much time to grieve myself since she is my first priority.,Time will heel her. That I can assure you.
Do you have any suggestions what I might try to cheer her up? After that I can worry about myself,Tell her to meditation or yoga in the morning. This will definitely helped and her mind will be busy
That might be ok. I know she likes Neil Diamond. Maybe get some of that playing while she meditates.,That is wonderful idea too . She will recover soon
Now what should I do for myself after she is better?,Be busy with your daily routine. Planning is the key
I thought about trying some daily exercise like just walking around the block a couple times with my dog.,Good idea! You can take your mom along with you in the park. She will recover soon.
"I thought about redecorating her house a little bit, they lived together for a long time maybe a change of scenery would do some good","Yes, try to do all thgings. But do one by one. That is my advice for you"
"Ok, well thanks for your help",Your welcome
I think when I start eating a little better things will improve too.,Start eating more fruits like me. I am trying to eat healthy.
"Ok good idea, Thanks",Your welcome
HI I have such trouble sleeping,Hello! How is life treating you right now?
Ok I guess but I can not shutt my brain off and relax,I see .. so I hear you saying that you are suffering from very bad anxiety?
"I guess, that would be what it is called I just always thought I am unable to sleep???",Ah I have had this problem myself. Have you consulted with your doctor?
No but I have been taking melatoning or pm medication but it does not really help either,I am not sure what sort of medications they are - are they specifically for insomnia?
"Melatonin, for sleep...and like tylenol PM... I also have taken over the counter sleep meds all of them are over the counteer","I tried those too but did not find them very effective, did you?"
"no i do not, but i do not want a prescription afraid of getting hooked","There are some sleeping pills out there that are not addictive, or at least I believe so"
"I am even worried that you could get hooked with the over the counter stuff...it is a rough spot, I see all the night time TV shows...",I think the over the counter things are generally considered safe but you could ask the pharmacist.
I guess I could...maybe it is age...,How old are you?
I am 56 years old,"Ah, I am in my mid forties, everything starts to get harder health wise after that age don't you think?"
I know it...LOL... things hurt i never even knew I had....,"And sleeping problems start emerging, sigh. Do you get a chance to nap during the day?"
"NO I have never been able to sleep during the day unless I was sick, I work fulltime also. so i leave my house at 6 am and get back at 3 pm then dinner and household...",Sounds like you have a very packed life. Maybe you need more time to yourself to relax?
Maybe just not sure how to get to that point,Is there anyone in your home that you can discuss this with? Spouse?
"LOL...you are funny my husband is self employeed I do all his paperwork, and he is not the empathetic kind...",I hear you on that one too :(. I think you are being put under unnecessary stress
I think you are right and I am sure I put a lot on that myself by trying to do everything right,What are the chances of you doing something just for y ourself soon? A spa day maybe?
I think I will do that ..it as good to talk to you....thanks for letting me vent,"No worries, I have a couple of minutes more to spare if you'd like to talk about something else :)"
NO I do appreciate it I got to get a shower...thanks again,"No problem at all :) can you just wait for the fifteen minute mark before pressing quit, thanks and have a great day"
"You too, you are very nice",It's a living :D
"Hi, I'm Anna","Hi there, how is life treating you right now? I am Jo, it is nice to meet you! Is there anything you'd like to talk about today?"
Going through a break-up. My 3rd one this year.... Nice to meet you too It suckssssss,"Gosh you've been busy :). I am sorry to hear that though - I know how much it hurts when you split with someone, especially if it was not consensual. It's a lousy time of year for it too, isn't it?"
"I feel like a piece of crap, and childish at that. I can't maintain any of my relationships. I think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life.",That is a defeatist way to talk! Just because a couple of relationships fail does not mean that you will never be able to find happiness.
"Well, if past experience has any powers of prediction. I get super clingy, and do this push and pull thingy, where I break up and call them names, and then become so embarrassed it's hard to even bring it up. my last boyfriend said he thought i had borderline disorder",I have been in that position too. I hate it when I realise that I am not being rational but I can't seem to stop myself sometimes and this has sometimes let to problems with my inter personal relationships
"Yea, that definitely seems to be part of my problem. I really thought he was different, too. And when he broke up with me, I tried to get him to spend the night with me in a hotel, and I felt so pathetic because I was practically begging for sex I think I am an addict.",I hear you on that one too! It's horrible to feel that you are losing your self respect but I suspect that we've all done it at some point. Have you considered getting some counselling?
Sigh.. yes. I have seen several. I also take meds from a psychiatrist.,"I hear you saying that they are not really effective, is that true?"
"Well... one told me that I should be put down like a dog to my face. so, yea",Okay .. I hope you reported him!!
I didn't. I was younger then. who knows. not gonna lie. maybe they're right. Sometimes I think I'm a psycho. My last therapist was always doing deep breathing exercises. It didn't help. I also have a lot of anxiety. A LOT! I even got an emotiona support dog,I understand that as well .. I am on medication for it. A dog is a wonderful thing to have! Do you feel that it has helped you?
"Yea, he's my best friend. At least I have one boy who has to stick around. He's on a tight leash",Dogs are very very loyal. They never cheat on you or walk out on you!
So trueee :) I just wish I wasn't such a freak.,I think you are probably not anywhere near as bad as you think you are you know :). Anyway I wish you all the very best for the New Year and hope that things pick up for you soon!
"Alright, bud. Thanks. You, too",take care! (you need to quit first and take the survey .. I can't :))
Can you help me?,"sure, what seems to be the problem"
I can't figure out why my friends don't understand why I want to keep a bit distant during COVID,I had the same issue with my friends as well
Really? What happened?,We stopped getting together and going out places cause they were all closed
"Yes, that happened here. But they still wanted to come over despite government orders limiting gatherings.","We now have weekly video call meetings instead, it helps us stay connected"
That sounds like a good idea. Is it hard to do?,"Not at all, we use a program called Skype, that's free. You can use it on your phone or PC"
My friends want to go out all the time. How can we connect during a Skype?,"Pick a time you'll both be available, and you'll both need the program. It's quite easy to use and there will be youtube videos that'll help you set it up, should you need it"
Do you do any activities together over Skype?,"We usually just chat about our week or get advice on normal things, sometimes we'll play a drinking game and be goofy together."
Are there other games people can play together on Skype because I don't drink?,"Drinking isn't a requirement, usually we'll just chat if we don't feel like drinking"
I just want to connect and please my friends but it is hard to not have any physical contact and only be online.,"I can understand that and it's definitely frustrating. But it'll be so much better once you can see other other again, cause absence makes the heart grow fonder"
"Wow, I didn't think of it that way. That puts a positive twist on it.","Yes, I always like to look for the positive in any given situation"
I believe that I can get over this time in my life but I need support.,What are you having a problem with?
My husband has cancer. I have been really depressed.,I understand how you are feeling. My mom had cancer. It really helped me to join a support group.
So how do you keep going without crying? How do I find a support group? I live in a rural place.,Crying is natural. You have every right to have those feelings. Don't try and stop yourself from crying.
Ok. How do I not cry in front of him?,There are online support groups you could get involved with.
Yeah but where do I find them?,You can google - online cancer support groups.
It makes it tough because I don't make as much money as he does/ What kind of cancer di your mother have?,My mother had rectal cancer. She went through a surgery and chemo and radiation and then she went into remission.
Oh he has a 25 percent of remission,"If you are having problems with money you might be able to qualify for food assistance through the SNAP program. Hang in there, I know it is rough but there is hope."
Yeah but food I can always get. Its paying the bills.,"Hang in there, I know it is rough but there is hope."
I know I will snap out of it and get my strength back. I always bounce back.,"Remember, as much as you need to be strong for him - you need to take care of yourself extra special during this time. Remember, as much as you need to be strong for him - you need to take care of yourself extra special during this time."
Yeah I have been. I am thinking about rewarding myself.,That's a great idea! You deserve it!
I really appreciate your help.,You are very welcome. I understand how you are feeling. I will pray for you.
Thank you I guess I should be going,"Alright, hang in there. You will get through this. Best wishes to you!"
Same to you bye.,Bye
Hey one more thing can I talk too you again?,Right now?
No another time.,I don't know if we are supposed to give out private information.
hi,Hey. How are you?
i am not feeling too great,Why not?
i am not able to find a job for over 5 years,How have you been able to get by?
i am on social assiatnce but its not enough and i feel so worthless,If you keep trying things will work out in the end
"but i have been tryin for so long, i dont know what ti do","Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews?"
yes I did do a lot of interveiws but no one hired me,"Perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong, because it have been a while"
i feel that i am not worthy and that no one thinks i am capable,"Dont think that. You are worthy, you just need to apply yourself in the right direction :)"
how can i do this,"Perhaps look for any job for now, even if they wage isn't good, because you have to start with something. You need some work experience"
i get depressed when i am rejected every time,"it happens that you get rejected, but it is the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and go again :)"
do you have any tools that can help manage my depression,Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation
how many times should i do this,"Maybe every day or a few times a week, depending on what you feel is necessary"
okay i will try this and see if this works. shall i also try walking or exercsing,"Yeah, anything to take your mind of it :)"
"Hi, how are you today?",I am okay. What is going on with you?
School's going badly. I really wish I had chosen a different major.,It sounds like it must be overwhelming to keep up with all of your school work.
I’m majoring in computer engineering. It’s really #%$& hard! Everyone else is way smarter than I am.,"That does sound very difficult, but I think you can do it! Just getting into a program like that shows how smart you are!"
It's kinda late to switch. I'm at the end of my third year. My parents keep bugging me about getting a job.,"To be honest with you, I switched majors a lot in college. I eventually let go of what my family thought and pursued a career I would truly enjoy for myself."
"I wish I were in your shoes! If I change majors now, I have to redo at least a year of school, maybe more. I don't think my parents want to pay for that.",Personally I took three years longer than it should to get my degree and accrued some debt because of it. Although I feel it is worth it now.
That's good to know. Maybe I can convince my parents to let me borrow some money. I don't want to be a computer engineer.,I'm hearing its difficult for you knowing that you are on a path that you don't really want to be on.
"That's a good way to put it. I've thought a lot about my options. I've thought about take a leave of absence, switching majors, going to trade school, traveling abroad...",A lot of people I know benefited from talking to an advisor or counselor for some direction. Have you done that recently?
"I talked to the school counselor. They laid out some options. It's really about money and time. If those weren't concerns, I would switch in a heartbeat.","What about meeting with the counselor with your parents, since it seems they would need to support you financially over any extra time it might take?"
"That's a good point. Maybe we could have a Zoom meeting, even for just 15 minutes. I need to get my parents to understand my feelings. The counselor might help me with that.",It's been shown that healthy communication can help people listen and respond more considerately when things seem difficult at first.
I hadn't thought of it that way. I'm so worried about schoolwork that I hadn't stepped back from the whole situation of school itself.,"I definitely can understand that, but it is important to think about your future happiness and security too!"
Hello.,"Good evening, what is going on?"
Hi. I have finals coming up and I am so so nervous about taking these tests.,What about the exams is making you nervous?
Taking them. I'm afraid I'm going to do poorly and have to retake the classes.,What steps have you taken to make sure you do not do poorly?
I study and I have gone to all my classes but I feel like I don't know the information well enough.,That is understandable. Sometimes we feel like we do not know enough. Have you tried to have someone quiz you?
Yes. I didn't do well on my quizzes.,"Okay, since you didn't do well, it seems you can pinpoint what you need to work on. That is a good starting point."
"Yes, that is a good point. I need to manage my nervousness too because it causes me to make silly mistakes.","Depending on how far your exams are, you can create a plan. Practice what you don't know daily, until you do know it."
That's really good advice.,Just trying to make life easier for others. Sometimes we don't see our solutions because of our anxiety.
Yes and it's definitely causing me to not think clearly.,Its best to take deep breaths and talk to someone who will help guide you.
I agree. I just feel bad burdening people with my issues .,Don't be. You would be surprised how many people are willing to help. Websites like Reddit are filled with many people wanting to give advice.
"Okay, I will give Te ddit a whirl. sorry Reddit",I hope it helps for future endeavors
Thank you for taking the time to chat with me. I appreciate your advice.v a dvice*,You are welcome :)
"Hello, I've been really depressed lately and feel like there isn't anything I can do to break this feeling.",Can you tell me what happened?
"November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS (its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family.",So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct?
Yes that is correct,I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It's like living alone in the forest.
"I know I'm not alone and that's what makes it hard to reach out, because I don't want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there's. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect.",I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don't want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person.
"I just don't know what to do about it anymore Yes, I don't like to bother others or let other people down",That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think?
"It is a lot, I'm used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief",I'm sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now.
"I'd be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity.","I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air? Oh, then drive around might be the only option"
"I'm hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it's not quite warn yet being in the northeast",Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern
I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn't as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february,Does where you live have a online social activity group on FB or an app called Neighbors? That could be a good way to communicate with others in a safe way.
"The local FB group is only full of everyone complaining about everyone else (seems when everyone is home things seem to get on peoples nerves more so then when people could get away from home consistently) but I've never heard of the app Neighbors, I'll have to look into that.",Give that a try. Maybe you will meet some friends there.
I will definitely have to look into that,Sounds great. I'm glad you didn't give up seeking for solutions to make yourself feel better
"Getting someone else's perspective helps because like you recommending that app, there are things I don't know about out there so I appreciate that.",You are welcome! Glad I can help
"You did thank you, and I hope you have a good day and a great weekend and stay safe yourself!",You too. Have a great weekend!!
"Hi, I'm feeling sad",Good afternoon
Good afternoon to you,Can I ask for a reason why
"Yes, my best friend has decided that I'm not that important...or as important as I thought I was....",What is causing you to be sad
"She used to call me multiple times per day, it's been 3 days and nothing",So this is a close friend
"Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends",That could cause a sadness
Absolutely...what do you think is wrong?,Could it be for a reason you are unaware of
"I'm not sure, I don't think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven't had a fight",Maybe she is busy and the timing is off Does your friend work
"Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn't even want me to help her, no she doesn't work",May not be a fight but she is busy settling in Does she live with her family
"Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband.",How long has it been since she moved in
"A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday",have you thought about a housewarming gift
"Hmm, no I didn't think about that, that may be a good idea",So just a week and she is settling in
"Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn't think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice.",Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you
"Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her :(",Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style
"That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories",Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help
"No, we are not seeing each other in person due to COVID. Do you think I should try calling or texting first?",sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there
"Yes, they certainly do, darn COVID stops everything","That would be a great idea, especially with the holidays"
Would a text be more appropriate vs. a phone call? What do you think?,Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people
"I just feel so hurt and abandoned, like I don't mean anything to her",Why not text her 1st to break the ice But maybe she is feeling like she is alone also
"Well, I think I will try that, I mean, it's not that intrusive. I hope she's not feeling alone, I hope she doesn't think I'm abandoning her!",The virus is stopping people but we can find away Does she have other family
"I am going to send her a message, do you think I should get her a digital gift card as a gift? Yes, she has a son in college.",The card could be a nice gift
I think I will text her and let her know I'm sending a gift card....maybe she will respond.,Text and ask about her son
That's a great idea! Thank you :),Surprise her with the card 1st Then follow up with a phone call
I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up,Can you tell me more about the fight?
"Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast...then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop.",Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else ?
It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up,"Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent"
Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes.,Have you talked since then?
We have talked a little bit before hand this month. It was okay but I am still sad about what happened She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn't ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety,"If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision"
I know but I am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. I still keep on thinking about her.,"I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don't be in a hurry to get into a new relationship , but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup?"
"I will definitely try to get over her using those techniques you just said. It's way harder to do than say though. No, this is not my first breakup with a woman but I felt like she was the one for me","Breakups are not always the end, but they usually happen for a reason, and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on"
Maybe you're right! Just need to get productive and get my mind off of her for good since she was violent,I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities
I will definitely try. I know it will be hard because I am upset still but sometimes I guess moving on is the only thing that you can do in this situation,The sadness will eventually pass and I am sure there is someone out there that will be a good match for you
Awww I hope so. Just like some people say...there are plenty of fish in the sea. Thank you for the advice. It was really helpful.,I wish you the very best .
Hi,Hello! How are you doing today?
"Not too good, I've just been feeling really tired lately. I haven't had the energy to do anything no matter how hard I try Then when I do manage to do something, I'm just so sad that its hard to find the motivation to put any effort in",What do you do for a living? Are you stretching yourself too thin?
"I'm a freelance writer so I can choose my own hours. I haven't been going over the top with my hours, I'm definitely doing less now than I did before",Sometimes I find that when I am doing less I end up being more exhausted.
"Yeah, the more I sleep the more I want to sleep. The fact that I don;t have set hours means that I just stay in bed for ages before a deadline",Have you been spending any time outside or exercising? Science has shown that boost of endorphins you get from sunlight or exercise can help with energy. I understand that it is easy to stay in bed all day until you absolutely have to do something.
No we're back in lockdown here so I've been staying inside unless I need groceries and stuff,Not having motivation is a tough feeling to overcome. I think a lot of people are suffering with this issue due to todays current affairs.
"Yeah I honestly think that's what's affected my mood, it doesn't help that my uncle recently got diagnosed with covid",Do you think it could help you if you tried to spend some more time outside or exercising?
I'm just burnt out I think. I have stopped exercising so that's something to consider,Even if you just do something easy like a walk around the block. Or sit in front of a window while the sun floods in on you.
Yeah I guess that's something I should consider,"I try to make sure that on sunny days I open all of my blinds. It forces me to get out of bed, and the vitamin D boost from the sunshine helps to keep me motivated. It sounds like you may be identifying some things that you could change?"
"I honestly can't tell the last time I even opened my blinds so I could do that. Yeah, you've given me a few ideas Thanks for that",That's great! I am glad to help. I am confident that you can overcome this time.
"Fingers crossed, I'll try those options you've given me though Thanks for listening in anyway",You are very welcome.
Hello,Hi how are you? how it's going on?
"I've been felling quite deppressed recently, just wanted to ask for some mental support",why are you feeling in that way? tell me what it's happening?
I both failed my final exam last week and my dog that I've owned for 10 years died 3 days ago,oh my god! I'm so sorry for that why do you failed your exam? did you study and prepared well?
honestly I think I did not study enough that's why I am blaming myself so much,What happen with your dog? it was sick?
It was from the old age I think Nothing to be done there,He or she were with you for a long time. you should remember him/her many times per day:( I know how are you feeling now
Yes I think about her many times per day thanks for understanding I was just thinking how can I help myself to move on,are you there?
yes,I can help you!
hi how are you today,"Hello , what is it that is bothering you?"
i haven't been feeling too good recently. i have just been generally depressed i am a bit worried,So you have been just generally feeling down and worried about everything?
i am worried a bit about loosing my job,I understand why that can have you worried. Have you been told this is a possibility?
no but i just don't get a good vib vibe,Have you talked to co workers or others about this?
my coworkers are almost always unavaible. and be cause we are all working remotely they just dont' answer ims,This is a worry that many others are having right now. Maybe there is an online group that deals in this type of worry.
that's a good idea! you mean within my company though?,"If your company has that, otherwise there are online chat groups that would."
"o? any recommendations? i don't really want work to know that i'm thinking that they are going to fire me, you know?",I don't have any experience in this area but I am sure that an online search would be easy.
"ok, i'll try it out. you don't think i should be worried about losing my job though?",I don't think that worrying about it ever does any good. All you can do is do your job well and display your worth to the company.
that's a good point,I usually find that taking action is a better idea than worrying.
true,Don't forget there are always options if something does happen.
that's great news! thank you! and i feel better already,Glad that I could help. Try to focus on positives.
thank you for all your help i'm not sure how this works after 15 min?,It's been very nice talking to you. Take care.
Hi,"Hi there, how are you feeling?"
Not feeling good. Trying to find a job but no success,It's a really hard time to be finding new work isn't it? Are you getting unemployment or anything?
I am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children.,Wow that's a lot of kids. Do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you?
As a single mother It's pretty hard to go to search for food bank. I am spending most of my time in looking for a job.,Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to?
I don't know any as I never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. Now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable.,"Do you have friends who could help you, even with child care?"
One of my friends was really helpful. She moved to different city last month. After that I am totally shattered.,I can imagine that that must have been traumatic. You will make new friends though.
Life is becoming hard day by day. I am feeling guilty that I can't feed my kids well. No one wants to do friendship with poor people.,I am a poor person too and I'd be happy to be your friend. We have to stick together!
Thank you so much for all your support. You will be a great person for sure. I would like to be your friend but I have nothing to return.,No need to return anything but friendship. Thanks for talking!
I would try to search near by food bank or NGOs as you suggested . Thank you so much for all you help.,"No problem at all ... I've been there :( (genuinely, not just for the HIT)"
Your words are motivational and it gave me positivity to move forward.,Best wishes :) You need to press quit from your end though cos I can't do it from my end :)
"Hi, I was wondering if you can help me with my academic issues.",yes. tell me what happened?
I am very stressed. My parents want to me to go to the school of their choice but its not looking good. If I dont go into their choice school I will have to pay for school on my own. Im not able to complete my work at school becuase of the stres,it sounds that you dont feel heard by your parents.
"Yes, they just tell me they want the best for me but its making my stomach hurt constantly",i think you have done your best and you are continuing to try hard. i think you have done your best and you are continuing to try hard.
Thank you. I just don't know what I should do about my school and future college endeavors,everything happens for a reason. you just have to stay calm.did you express yourself to your friends or a caretaker?
My friends just tell me to take loans out like they are.,do you think that will help you out?
I think it would but I don't want to go into debt because of college,try do get some online jobs so that you can cop up with both your college and finances.
Okay I can try and do that,"yes, i hope everything ends well."
Thank you,welcome
Hello,Hello! How's it going? How can I help you today?
Hi. It has been better.,We all have those days :/ what's bothering you?
I can't seem to get motivated.,It sounds like your having trouble giving yourself that little push to get the wheels turning. I've totally been there. What do you feel is the reason?
I don't feel like it is worth it.,"I understand, I've been there before. You just have to take one step at a time and not overwhelm yourself . Have you tried any tools to help you get going?"
What kind of tools would you suggest?,"What I find that works is to make out a list of all the things you want to accomplish and the possible steps you need to get there. It also helps to let someone know how you feel like a friend or relative, you would be surprised that being open with people can open up new doors in life."
I can talk to my friends sometimes. I have big goals but can't seem to get little things right.,"You feel like your friends don't listen or care? And trust me you are not alone. I am going through that as well. I messed up so you can say, but as time went on I realized that I can't live like how I was living anymore and I SLOWLY moved towards my goals. I just graduated phlebotomy school for example. What are your goals?"
Wow that's amazing. I want to start my own business but I have no money to start with.,"Thank you! Yeah money is tight these days especially with the pandemic going on. If your business has a good idea there are many venture capitalist that are willing to invest in your idea. You can search for websites and pitch it to them. But don't let anyone stop you, you can do it! Or even search for people in different forums with the same ideas as you, you guys can collaborate and possibly bounce your ideas off each other. There are also loans you can get from the bank. Don't get discouraged. It's never too late."
That is a great suggestion What else do you know? THank you for the encouragement by the way,"Check out crowd funding websites. Like go fund me, indi gogo, kick starter, and just giving. No problem! I'm glad I got to help! Please check out those websites especially kick starter because you basically pitch your idea and people invest in real time. Right away. I'm really glad I got to talk to you, you can do it. At least you have goals right?! That's already passed the first step. You got this! I hope everything works out for you."
Hello,Hello! How are you today?
"I am good, just feeling low.",I'm so sorry to hear that. Why are you feeling low?
I just broke up with my boyfriend and the situation is honestly frustrating me.,"Oh, wow that must be so hard. Breaksups are are always really difficult to process."
"Yeah, it is really draining and I don't know what to do?",Have you tried talking about the breakup? Sometimes letting it out really helps.
"Not really, I basically have no one to talk.","THat is so hard. you can talk to me if you want, what was the cause of the breakup?"
We had an argument about money. He thinks I have been spending so much and he wanted me to stop his credit card. using**,Oof that is a tough one. Did you agree?
I had to but it was not fair.,That seems very unfair. You can try talking to him about your feelings ina. calm way.
I would try that and see if it can work out. I am afraid it might not. What other option can I use? Hello?,"sory abut that I think you should talk to him logically. Think through all the reasons why you shold be together and how this can be resolved. Like, you won't use his card anymore and you can work on a budget together."
Thank you. Okay will do that. I think that it.,"Great, i think it will work out for you!! i have faith. I recently went through something similar nad it helped me."
Thank you.,Anytime. I hope you guys can work it out.
"Yes, I hope we do.",Havea. good day!
I don't know what do with my life.,I know sometimes it can be difficult to make decisions. What dilemma are you facing today?
I can't seem to decide anything with my life.,"I too, have been in your place. There were days I would just stare blankly without being productive. However, I tried meditating which helped me improve my focus."
Does that really help? How do you start?,"I am glad you asked. At first, it can seem a little difficult. But the key is to start small and build as you go. For example, allocating 10 minutes after lunch or borrowing some time off of social media."
What exactly do you? How can it help me make decisions without getting anxious?,"From what I know, you can try to relax before making any decision. I usually follow my intuition and decide. I deal with the outcome later. But meditating has really helped me avoid anxiety."
I often feel like I'm just going to mess up anyways so I don't see the point in even trying sometimes.,It sounds as if you are low on self-confidence and are afraid about unfavourable outcomes. Please correct me if I am wrong.
"That sounds about right. I recognize it but I don't know how to deal with it. I'm so afraid of failing, I end up not doing anything.",I can feel your anxiety just through this chat conversation.
I tend to expect the worse or nothing at all.,"In my experience, even if we were to fail, we are bestowed with a valuable life lesson which we can use in future decisions. Approaching the problem with positive mindset will help a lot! Is that something you'd be willing to try?"
"I suppose so, but it's hard to break habits and a mindset that I've cultivated.","That's true. However, research shows that any habit can be broken or formed if you put your mind to it everyday for 5-10 minutes for 3 continuous weeks. Perhaps, replacing your negative thoughts with happy ones might help."
"I guess it's a start. I can do three weeks, and hopefully move on from there.",Awesome. I am glad I was able to get you started towards a positive mentality. Is there anything else that I can assist you with today?
That's all for now. Thanks for listening.,You're welcome! Have a wonderful week ahead!
hello,Hello. How are you today?
i'm fine how are you doing too?,"Im glad to hear that. I am doing well today, thank you for asking! Is there something on your mind you'd like to chat about? I'm here to listen."
i had a breakup just a year ago and its taking its toll on me,I'm sorry to hear that. Recovering from a break up can take a long time. How long were you together?
4 years,"That is a long time. I think its normal to take time to recover after a long relationship, after all it was a significant part of your life for 4 years."
"yes, we were both planning on getting married","I've struggled with the same situation. Do you want to tell me what kind of feelings you are struggling with? That is a lot to deal with, I am so sorry."
i am very saddened by the breakup,I hear and feel your grief. Would you call it grief? Please let me know.
close to grief but she is still alive i saw her last week and it was like a bomb was dropped on me,"i understand. Grief is the emotion of sadness and loss, does that resonate with you?"
exactly,"I was just going to ask you if you still see her, that must have been so difficult."
very difficult she looks soo beautiful,"The hollidays were very hard for me after my break up, we were going to marry like you. Isort the season and all the expectations and memories of exacerbated the loss for me. Do you think that might be making you feel worse? Have you considered that You must be beautiful/handsome for her to be attracted to you."
i think our problem started when we moved in together i always felt soo lucky to have her because she is always perfect,"I just want to say that the hollidays will be over soon and that may help. I'm sorry, it sounds like you loved her very much."
i loved her just too much and the holiday is not helping the matter because i felt soo lonely,Experts say that feeling your feelings and talking about them is really good for you to help get over a long breakup. Also that it takes a year or more to process. So know that you are doing the right things.
really,"I was really lonely after my breakup too. I had to make myself spend time with other people that cared about me like friends and family. Even though I kind of just wanted to stay sad making myself be around other people that reminded me of the good, perfect and lovable things about myself made me feel better and gave me hope. Maybe easing your lonliness would give you some relief?"
so you are advising me to go out more and mixed up with people,You sound like a sensitive and loving person. Those are wonderful qualities. I noticed them and we are strangers. I'm sure you have many more.
you are soo kind,It sounds like you don't feel like going out?
i dont know what i think of my self really i rally dont feel like going anywhere,It's normal to feel the way you do as you sort out what happened and how to go forward.
ok i will do that thanks,"If you dont feel like being around people, what really helped me was reminding myself of the good things about myself. Sometimes I even made a list so I didn't forget. And staying distracted sometimes helped too. Experts say coming up with some goal or project really helps."
"ok, thats a good idea","There are also so many articles and support on the internet, don't be afraid to just search ""getting over a relationship"" or 'bad breakup advice"" there are so many people that have gone through this. Ypu are not alone. I know that nothing I say can take away your pain or make it not have happened, but I care that you have these feelings and I care about you."
"thanks, i will check them out thanks for the show of love","you are welcome. i hope you feel supported and encouraged. I know this will get better for you. take care of and love yourself, friend. you are worth it."
i will do that. thanks,"and one last thing that worked for me was when I was really fixated on how perfect my ex was, i'd make a list of why they weren't and why we weren't good together. It made me think in a more balanced way."
"really, and it worked? i will try that","yeah, it did work. even when all could see was how great my ex was i could at least see why we didn't work and i wanted us both to be happy so writing that stuff helped me keep it in perspective. Its been a privilege listening to you . i'm wishing you all good things."
"oh, thanks thanks for the advice i will work on it bye","you're welcome. don't be afraid to reach out to others in this time, you are valuable. i hope you have a good rest of the week. bye"
what should I do?,Can you tell me a little more about your situation so I can better understand?
My friend's husband is spreading false rumors about me because my daughter moved up in soccer and theirs didn't. He's telling people it's because I'm having an affair with the coach - who is married! This is not true! My daughter is a better soccer player. what do you think I should do?,"It sounds like your friend's husband might be jealous of your daughter, or embarrassed that his daughter did not get moved up also. Have you spoken to your friend about this?"
I haven't yet. I was deciding whether or not to talk to him directly or just her or both at the same time. I am really upset and don't want to lose her. I know people get all crazy about their kids and sports. I agree that he's jealous but his daughter isn't really that good - didn't make the school team either. Should I talk to my friend alone first?,It depends on the depth of the relationship between the three of you. How long have you all been friends?
"About 6 years. Our daughters are also friends, too. I am single so I don't care about the husband but also don't want to come in between their marriage.","Yes, that is a difficult situation to know how to handle. It could be in your best interest to leave your friend out of it so she doesn't feel stuck in the middle or forced to take sides. However she could view the opposite as you going behind her back."
yes that's true. I don't want to go behind her back but also don't want to get her involved. I could have the coach talk to the dad maybe?,"Yes, coaches are a great resource for life's dilemmas. Perhaps another option would be to casually mention something to him in passing, like at one your daughters games as to avoid any big blowups or emotional exlosions."
Oh that's a good idea - in public and not making a big deal about it - and before she moves teams and rumors get worse.,That is exactly right. Each person handles and avoids conflict differently and you have the important roll as leader in all of this. There is a chance he is not aware of the strain this has put on you emotionally and he could respond well to not being called out by someone else. Does that make sense?
it does - but doesn't seem that he cares about my strain on my life since he's the one spreading such lies about me. I just hate him!,"I can understand how you would feel like he doesn't care about the strain it's placed. Can I ask, are your daughters aware or involved in these rumor's? This could make a difference in how you could respond."
I did tell her because I was so mad when another mom told me. She doesn't care. She still likes the friend but not the dad.,"Sounds like your daughter has a good head on her shoulders. Maybe there's something to be learned from her reaction to all of this. I understand how hard this has been for you so perhaps simply ignoring the rumors will allow you to heal quicker, by simply being the bigger person. Because rumors are just rumors, after all. You and your daughter know the truth and that's all that matters."
yes you're right. I will try to just ignore. And figure out what to do with my anger over all this? Maybe go for a run and also avoid him?,"If he knows you know and you rise above with a smile on your face, that could show him that you are more mature than his childish games, and that you mean business. By taking ownership of your own feelings and emotions, you might find that will squash your need to let out any anger towards him."
"oh I like that and I am willing to try. I am tired of wasting my energy being so angry at this man who like you said is jealous which is HIS problem and shouldn't be might, right?!",Exactly. Let his problems remain his. You worry about you and your daughter and he can watch from a distance confused at his failed attempt to reflect his own dissatisfaction with life onto you didn't work. I think you will feel freed of any stress this has caused.
hello,"hello, how are you today?"
I'm doing okay today. Been sad because my dog died,are you there?
Hello? yes I am typing can't you see?,I can now... they all popped up at once.
ok bad connection,I am so sorry... How old was your dog? I have a great Pyrenees
she would have been 15 next month Great Pyrenees are beautiful Mine was a fox terrier chihuahua mix,I am so sorry. I cant even imagine how sad you are right now. Was she sick?
She was blind and suffering from dementia,Bless her heart. How long ago was this?
"She was starting to walk in circles and standing in corners like she had no idea where she was. I couldn't keep watching her do that anymore so I had her put to sleep, but I miss her so much. on saturday","sometimes just talking about it can help with the grieving process. I have lost a pet, but not one that was mine in adulthood."
Before she went blind she was so loving and playful. After she went blind she started to sleep a lot,It sounds like she had a long happy life.. 15 is pretty old. This is the hardest part about having pets. Poor thing. How long had she been blind? Were you able to be there with her?
They never live long enough. I had her brother too. He died 7 years ago. He got out on the road and hit by a car/ She went blind early in the spring. I held her while the vet gave her the shots,I'm so sorry this has happened. Some say getting another one helps. I have never been through it but do you think it would? I would think it would take time to be able to but some people get another dog really fast.
I have been thinking about it. I haven't made up my mind yet though,"ugh, it sounds so hard. My dog is 2 and just had a birthday. I made him a meatloaf birthday cake. I cant imagine how you feel. Maybe volunteering at a local shelter would help?..I really hope you feel better soon"
Hello. Hello?,hey how are you doing?
"Doing alright, thanks. Yourself?","Doing fine, thank you."
Good to hear.,What brings you here today?
I've been feeling very down lately.,"That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that?"
Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It's very overwhelming.,"That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now."
Yes and a lot of uncetainty.,"Most definitely, I've also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what's going on. How have you been coping?"
It's good to know others feel the way I do. I've been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much.,"That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming."
Yes with lots of conflicting information.,What do you like to do to keep busy?
"Work, read, exercise. I've been going to the gym more.",Those sound like really good coping skills.
Thank you. I'm trying. I really don't want to be on medication.,That's a personal choice you're completely allowed to make. It sounds like you have a good foundation for building on your ability to cope.
I am trying. I don't want to fall deep down an emotional black hole.,Understandable Do you talk with a therapist or have someone you trust you like to talk to?
"Yes, my husband is very supportive but I don't want to upset him too much so I don't fully open up.",That's great he is supportive. Seeing an individual counselor or someone of the like can also be helpful. They're there for just you and they have unbiased opinions. A lot are doing telehealth right now.
I will look into the telehealth. Thank you for that recommendation.,"You're welcome, hopefully it can be helpful. I, myself, have used telehealth therapy recently and it's just been helpful with all the unprecedented chaos going on this year."
I will give that a try. Thank you again.,Is there anything else you would like to talk about or that I can help you with today?
Hello,"Hi, so tell me, how are you feeling today?"
I am feeling depressed,"If you tell me what's going on, I will be more than glad to help"
I can't pinpoint what exactly is making me feel this way. It could be the pandemic. But basically I started to feel that there is not much point in anything.,"The pandemic can definetely be a key factor here. When it first started, I remember feeling lost and unsure about things that I would normally would have no problem with. If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?"
I am 30,"Do you have any family, girlfriend, boyfriend, children?"
I have family and a boyfriend but they all live far and I have not seen them in while.,"Not seeing your closed ones or simply being apart from them can be more than enough to make us feel depressed or blue. Have you tried doing videocalls with them, for example?"
Yes sometimes. I don't tell them how I feel though. I don't want them to worry about me.,"I understand. However, there is nothing wrong with telling them that you are sad because you miss them. Something as simple as getting it off your chest can already make you feel better."
I suppose. I just worry that I will make them sad too. It's hard time for everyone.,"Totally, but remember than they are there for you whenever you need them."
Yes that's true. Do you have any suggestions on what to say?,"I bet something as simple as ""Hey babe, I really miss you. I can't be glad with your abscence"" could make your boyfriend feel loved while at the same time relieving you."
That is true. I believe I have a problem showing vulnerability.,"That might be why you were unsure about telling them. Believe me, there is nothing wrong with showing vulnerability. We are all vulnerable in one way or another."
I haven't been with my boyfriend that long before the pandemic started so I still have some fears and trust issues. I fear that being weak pushes people away.,"Hey, if he is the right one for you, he will completeley accept you as you are and love you. In the unlikely event that he ""rejects"" you for being ""vulnerable"", he wasn't even worth it in the first place. You deserve someone that appreciates you as much as you appreciate them :3"
That is true. I should be brave enough to find out if he will be there when the chips are down. I am going to do it,I believe in you!
Thank you for supporting me.,It has been a pleasure!
Enjoy the rest of your day.,You too! (You have to hit Quit and fill the questionarie)
hello,"hello, how are you?"
i'm feeling sad and tearful yet again,oh! can ask you why?
i miss my husband so much i left him a couple of years ago,you can share you problem with me freely
he didn't communicate....listened well but wouldn't talk or share of himself verbally...i got so frustrated,Oh ! that's very sad but try to move out from this

i am depressed so it's hard to get moving on stuff i want to do...i feel so low,Try to live i future forget past try to make your self happy
its hard to plan a future when i am grieving....i don't know how to make myself happy,don't be sad because of past

how long did it take her,Try to left past in pin
"i try not to think of him but he keeps popping in my mind, without even inviting the thoughts",She went through this two years in this situation
"he was so patient kind and supportive, i miss that about him oh i see it's lonely living alone that's making me sad too",try to do some yoga it will help you
That's a good idea,Try to go join some other activities that make you feel better
i not only miss my husband but i miss my friends because of covid I can't see them that's a good idea....but the stupid pandemic makes that hard...maybe i should look for a virtual activity,Yes i know that hard situation for everyone
"yes it is....i am so relieved that people are starting to get vaccines, there is hope",but try do all things at home . stay safe as well
yes that's important i agree maybe once i get more active i will miss him less,yes that's very goo people taking vaccine yes try to watch comedy movies that make you happy
a friend of mine suggested dating but I have ZERO interest in that,or laughter programs
"comedy yes, i have been doing some of that, and standup comics too, it does help i am running out of funny shows and movies on netflix, hehe but i agree that helps",that's very good
"i can't watch violent shows right now while i feel low, it just makes me feel worse",Please try to watch those things that make you happy

Hello.,hi there How are you?
I am so frustrated.,May I ask why you are feeling frustrated?
"Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID.","Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school."
Yes I don't even know what is going to happen with finals now.,"I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school?"
"I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better. Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor.","that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that!"
Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online.,Have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors?
"Yes, I talked with my friend about it and she said don't worry. But I can't help it.","I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly."
I was doing so well in my classes too. Very close to graduating.,Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online?
"Yes, I don't do well with online learning.",I have seen that be the case for many people. Hopefully your professors will be understanding with the switch.
I hope so too.,Well I really hope that everything goes well for you! You sound like you are prepared
Thank you and thanks for letting me confide in you. It's a weird and sad time these days.,of course! I hope the rest of your year goes well
Thank you so much. And I hope all is well by you too.,Thank you!
hello,"hi there, how can i help you this evening?"
I am just alone and have nobody to talk to and can't make friends because i have been through too much,"im sorry to hear that, care to talk about it?"
sure,why do yo think you are having a hard time making fiendships?
Because everyone I come across is into drugs and I do not do drugs,are you in support or recovery yourself?
recovery myself. I can not do it but I also have relapsed because of someone I met so I am just alone now because I am not going to do drugs again,"i know that can be a very tough situation, my father and brother are both addicts. it helps to have a good support structure around you to stay in your sobriety . do you go to any group meetings or support groups?"
"yes it does and I have no support because i moved to a new state so all my family is in tn and i am in ga now, no i do not i might think about that though i was thinking of maybe doing something online, but my finance is and i are doing a long distance thing for now and I do not want to accidentally go over a line if i happen to be paired with a male to talk to so i am just here waiting for him to get home","well, when it comes to support groups, you can choose your sponsors and people who you want to build your support group with, i know it can be hard living in a state away from your family, i live in California and my family lives in Texas. You could also look at married men as an acceptable solution to avoiding that line as well. are you religious at all?"
no i dont think that would go over well. No i am agnostic. I do wish i had a good friend that knew me who I could talk to. he told me i could talk to one friend in tn and i call when i need something but it bothers him so i try not to do that.,"there are always groups on social media, some are even local. so your fiance is upset when you talk to your friend back home?"
yeah it bothers him. and i don't want to bother him.,is your fiancé in reovery himself?
yes he is.,do you talk to him about how you are feeling about your recovery as well? or is this conversations that you only have with your friend?
i talk to him about everything. he has been a good listener.,well thats great!! its important to have someone you can vent to. well thats great!! its important to have someone you can vent to. sorry dont know why that posted twice.
yes it is. i thank you for your time. I hope you have a good day. thanks for the chat.,your welcome. good luck. and im proud of your sobriety!! :)
"Hey there, how's it going?",I am doing good. How are you?
"I'm ok, I could be better. I'm trying to find a job currently.",What kind of jobs are you looking for?
"Anything involving my college degree. But when I do get to the interview stage, I feel like I don't know anything. I feel like an imposter.",Was it a phone interview or in-person interview?
In-person.,"so, you are good with initial assessment and phone interview, and get uncomfortable during in-person interview, is that correct?"
"Yes, I stumble over my words, I tend to ramble, and I'm afraid I don't even answer the questions the way they are looking for.",Have you tried anything yet to overcome this challenge?
I try to prep myself beforehand by having lines ready for the common questions asked. But I struggle with questions where they present scenarios to me.,There are several technics people use.. first one you can dress up as you are going for interview and practice talking in front of a mirror.
"I really like that suggestion, I will have to try it. Do you have any difficulties with interviews?","Not really, but I used one other technique. I asked my wife/gf to interview me. You know spouse or gf/bf would be very critical, and if you overcome him/her.. you would be very comfortable in front of the others."
"That makes a lot of sense, I'll have to ask my husband to interview me. I'm feeling a lot better about this now, thank you :) Did you ever feel silly or out of place when your wife would interview you?","yes, making your self uncomfortable means you are learning"
"I have never thought about it like that. That makes a lot of sense, I'm going to keep that in mind in all aspects of my life.","Yes, this is make you over come the fear."
"Yeah, I do let fear take control of most of my decision making. That's something I can work on, too. Thank you bird-person",Is there something else I can help you with? If not can you close the discussion?
"Hi there, how's it going?","Hi, how are you?"
"Not so good, you?",I am sorry to hear that. What is going on?
This pandemic has me stressed about my job stability.,"So you are worried you may lose your job due to the pandemic, is that correct?"
Yes. My firm has already cut 15%. I am fearful I'll be next since I'm a low level employee.,It seems to me from chatting with you that you are extremely anxious about the situation.
"Yes, very. If I were to get fired. I have no idea what to do for my future.",I completely understand as I was in the same situation when the pandemic started and I wasn't sure if I was going to keep my job.
"Where I live, we currently have a lock down. I feel like small businesses will be forced to shut down. Economy is getting worse. My anxiety is getting worse.",What industry do you currently work in?
Finance.,"I know this is an extremely hard situation, but I know you can make it through it!"
I doubt it. But thanks for the positive vibes. Is there a lock down where you live?,"Yes, we are currently in a lock down. Have you had a talk with your supervisor about the situation?"
"Yes, but he can only do so much to be honest.","Something I used to do when I was struggling with anxiety over this was come home and play video games, which is something I really enjoy doing. Have you tried to really dive into more activities that you enjoy?"
I do sometimes. Which games do you recommend?,"I play a lot of sports games, mostly racing."
Hello I am here to discuss my anxiety over the current pandemic.,"Hey there! That's a good topic to talk about. With everything that's been going on, it's normal to feel some anxiety. What do you think is one thing that is giving you a lot of anxiety?"
Thank you very much for your understanding. Yeah it's tough especially with rising cases for the past two weeks or so in my city. I live in Canada and my city is pretty good so far and really low on numbers but have been seeing new cases every day for the last two weeks or so so that adds anxiety to me when I go out and I am more on guard and paranoid,"I'm sorry to hear that. Similar stuff is happening where I am, and I also get anxious hearing about it."
"And we had a lock-down earlier this year and yet, with the exception of one province, every province remains operational at full speed despite lock-downs earlier, and now a lot of provinces are seeing record cases with the second wave. yeah I hope you get through this okay also and stay safe and well.","What do you feel when you feel on guard and paranoid? Try to say some more about that if you can. Thanks, I hope the same for you."
"I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time. And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March.","Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. It's still around in our day-to-day lives. Well said. You feel stuck. The usual things you would do now are just not available to you."
"yeah I have been adjusting to it and the cases were down and even to zero in my city for most of the last few months, but there's definitely the start of a new community spread now. yes correct Plus there's a loss of routine or motivation. I procrastinate a lot and get lost in thought or lost without thought. I don't work out as much as I used to (inside or outside of home). I don't eat as well and my sleep pattern is not good at all (I sleep a lot later than I should). So I am disappointed in myself to say the least. and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive","I can rephrase some of this, if you don't mind. In a way, you're talking about activities that you may have used (gym, hikes, etc) to keep yourself in a good mood. Now that those don't seem available, you just don't have those opportunities to boost your mood. It makes sense that you would be feeling this way."
"now I am more used to it of course, but this summarizes how I have been feeling for most of this year.",I think you explained yourself really well. Thanks for sharing how you've been feeling.
"yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but I didn't want to gamble and compromise. And I still see those people as selfish when I choose to do what I think is right. yeah no worries. It's good that you understand and thank you for listening.",Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them?
We won't know more about the mental implications and the sociological aspects of the pandemic probably until years to come. I thought about that,"Yeah, and that just throws on another layer of why things are difficult right now. No one wants to feel guilty for doing things that could help themselves."
"to the gym, I certainly would. Because it's indoors and I do feel it's unsafe as there are many equipment that others could touch. Running I felt that way because the path that I usually run on is narrow and other people walk through it also. However, I did have second thoughts about that when the case numbers were down. But I finally decided to keep doing it and stick to all outdoor trips for essential business. but that's just me, and I know we all have different personalities, preferences, and tolerances of risks and acceptances, etc.","Have you ever heard of the phrase ""black or white thinking?"" As in, thinking that situations or people are completely good or completely bad? Or completely doable or completely impossible?"
"so in my opinion, I feel a little indignant at the people that have been going out frivolously like there's nothing going on, to even gamble their safety and their family's. Like I live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety. So I just didn't feel it was fair for them to do that when I could have done that anytime I wanted. black and white thinking...let me think for this pandemic, it's pretty much black and white","Yeah, I think I understand that too. I get really frustrated hearing about people hosting big parties or not wearing masks because they think it's no big deal. They're putting others at risk."
"Because I either go out or I don't. I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right. Because if I had done that, I would have done that already, and long ago. And even though it's really hard on me. yeah exactly. Because people are being selfish and are subjecting others to risks even if they don't care about themselves. but I know I am pretty extreme in my thinking. I really love the outdoors and I go out pretty often before the pandemic. But it's just that my own thinking is rigid and made up about it. But anyhow, that's the situation in a nutshell.","I think we all do black-or-white thinking to some extent. We're wired to try and make sense of the world, and maybe our brains don't like to spend time on nuance and grey areas. We all tend to quickly categorize things into good or bad, easy or hard, black or white."
"yeah I understand your thinking with the grey areas as well. I suppose for this case, it's all black and white for me, no grea areas or compromises. that's good analysis by the way. But anyhow I am good to go then. Thank you so very much for understanding and for your valuable inputs.","Does this time have to be a ""waste"" for you? With no productivity? That seems pretty extreme."
"it's a fascinating area though, fascinating thinking. I am also curious on the social and mental implications of this in the long-run but only time will tell there will be so much research and books written about our times. well I do a lot of ""waste"" at home. So I am quite sluggish and lazy and lost at home.","Thanks for saying that! I liked talking with you, and we can wrap this up. I guess I'm saying you sound thoughtful and intelligent, I'm confident that you could find ways to get more out of this time if that's what you're wanting to do."
"I am productive but not as driven or productive as before at home. for sure yeah. I am sure we can get through all this in one piece eventually. I was thinking this also that even though this is a very tough time, we will look back on this about years from now, and say wow, we got through all that!",Not as productive? Of course! It's a pandemic. We all are. :) Hope you're not too hard on yourself right now.
no no I am okay thanks for asking I am just kind of spelling in out the details of my thinking and how my life has been so far I am actually okay so no worries,"Ha, exactly. Maybe we're not all thriving and getting rich and adding 15 pounds of muscle during this time. But we can get through it."
yup. Exactly. Lost time can always be made up later. okay then. I am good to go. Thanks again and thank you for your input. It does help to just kind of vent in a way.,"Before we quit, would you want to say one specific thing you know you can do today to help yourself out?"
Yeah for sure I worked out a little bit before I started the chat. I am also doing some online courses on my own time. So I will keep working hard on those. And I hope to get back more into the routine of working out. I really do think it helps my mood if I just make more time and motivation for that. And you seem intelligent and analytical also and you know what I mean. So I do appreciate your time and input,Nice! Good job with those things.
thanks. I hope you best of luck then with all your endeavours. I know we can all get through this time. Thank you. stay well and stay safe my friend,"Right on, same to you. It's okay to feel anxious right now. It's okay to feel unproductive right now. It's also okay to keep on doing the things that make you feel okay. Great job keeping up the workouts and the classes."
Thank you and all the best.,Stay well and safe to you too! Take care.
hi,"HI, how's. your day going?"
Well is is going how about you?,I'm working hard? What are you doing?
i am at work today but we are on reduced hours and thats not easy since my paycheck is quite smaller,I understand that. I have a smilier situations and bills don't stop for reduced hours
"exactly, and my husband was sick for a long time and unable to work so it is very stress ful",Is he feeling better now?
"Yes he is better, he is self employeed so he had no income whatsoever",well that's good news. I am sure you are continuing to try hard
we do but we can't egt any help from outside since for them we still make to much money but not enough to pay everything and eat and pay hospital bills,it sounds like you are stress about the situation and overwhelmed trying to find a path forward
that would sum it up.,do you have a plan to resolve the situation?
no not really.... I can only work i am at my end,is there something else you can do at your job or take on another part time job to help. make ends meet? I know there are lots of open jobs out there
It is hard to find something we live pretty rural then driving times and gas will get complicated,I am sure you have done your best and are continuing to try hard
I have anxiety about what avenue to take academically,"Hello! Don't worry, I am here to help. So you are saying that you are not sure what career to study?"
I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn't chosen,"Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like : ), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example."
"I suppose you're right, I think I don't have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it. Good enough to make a life out of it. fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time",I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently.
but what if that thing is your career choice?,"That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It's normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong ,you can always change your major."
I guess thats right. All I care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine. thank you for your help,"No problem, and it's great that you like helping others. I am a firm believer that ultimately making others happy is what makes us happy."
"yes, it is very rewarding to do so, it should be a part of everyone's life choices i agree with you on that",Remember to always keep a positive mindset. I am sure you will sort this out in no time. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
"I am sure you are right, I just get caught up in my thoughts too much. have a great day! no thank you are you still there","Yes, sorry And it has been a pleasure : )"
why does it say im ending the chat early when it has been enough time already,"Try again, you have to hit quit and fill the questionarie"
Hello,Hello. What seems to be the issue?
I don't have close friends because I don't trust people,You said you generally don't trust family or people in general?
"people in general, I do trust certain family members",Just people who are close to you?
"no, I have a hard time trusting people i don't know in order to make friends","I have had a hard time trusting strangers, but that is not a big problem. I used to be the same way, but I learned about how to make and keep close friends."
i think it feels like a problem because I never let anyone too close in order to make friends and have an external support system how did you do it,I joined volunteer groups to help others. I made friends with like-minded people who volunteered to make a difference.
I actually think that is a great idea. I have never thought of doing that for that specific purpose.,Groups like Habitat for Humanity or UNICEF will help you to build long-lasting friendships. It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active.
"I guess it makes a lot of sense. If you go to a party or a bar, you don't know what you will get, as it is a mixed bag of personalities. Whereas if you go to something like what you suggested then you already know that the people you meet have the same kind of heart.",You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method.
"Thank you for that suggestion, that is really helpful and something that I will take with me from now on.","Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join. Did you need help with anything else?"
"I feel ok being alone mostly, but other times I would like to have people I could relate with and hang out with. Probably has a lot to do with ADHD and how I feel misunderstood or my anxiety gets the best of me in social situations","I understand the ADHD. There are support groups that can help you make friends; especially with ADHD, etc."
do you know any specific groups?,"Using tools to build houses helps to release endorphins, which can release anxiety."
is this something you have done?,"There is a group called, ""Harry House"" that provides support to those with ADHD and anxiety."
"oh ok! I will certainly look that up, thank you for that information.",Surely. Is there anything else you need help with?
Does one have to travel far to participate in building houses?,"No, Habitat fir Humanity has car pools."
do you know if it requires a person to be away from home a long time?,They are a good group to help you build meaningful relationships. I used to do a hour at a time; maybe one or twice a week.
oh! so a person could just choose how often and how long they participate?,Would you be interested in something like HFH?
"thank you for sharing with me, i might like to participate in it in the future","Yes, you can sign up online to join a project."
"ok i will look that up, thank you for all your help","Yes, you can volunteer locally; HFH is nationwide."
ok thank you,Any other questions? I am glad to assist.
"no other questions, you have been most helpful, thank you!",I have done volunteer work; people want to be friends with those who care and know how to use a nail and hammer. :)
LOL good to know! Thanks for the chat and I hope you have good holidays!,It may also help to contribute some money to keep the organization going. I felt great after making friends and building homes for low income people.
hi there,Hi! Hope you are doing well. How can I help you today?
I am having such a hard time falling asleep at night....I toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off,It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right?
yes that's right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. I am irritable and frustrated.,Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long?
"I worry about my daughter, she has addictions. I never know if she is okay or not, she doesn't call me very often and is hard to get a hold of.",It must be a tough time for you and is a enough reason to not getting good sleep. despite of it you should need a complete rest .
"Have you any suggestions to help me get to sleep easier? I have tried meditation, but it doesn't seem to help much.",I feels like you are having less energy and feel tired due to lack of sleep. Try to follow a particular schedule and u can put soothing music before bed. It might calm you down and make you sleep.
"That's a good idea I can try that. My bedtimes are kind of mixed up, maybe setting a particular schedule will help, I'll try that sometimes i go to be early, sometimes late, maybe that is screwing me up","When I have sleeping problem, I take warm shower. It help me a lot."
"good idea, i could try that",As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it.
"oh ok, that makes sense i wish my daughter lived closer so i can check on her, she is in another city which makes it hard i worry ok well thankyou for your help",I can understand how hard it is for you. But nothing stays same. I wish your daughter will come out of it soon and wishing her success. Meditation can help you too. Before sleeping you can concentrate on your breath.
I appreciate your suggestions and will give them a try. The warm shower sounds like a really good idea. Thankyou so much. are you a parent?,Best wish for you! Wishing you will have a nice sleep and refresh day afterwards.
"thank you i apprecaite that, to you as well","Yes, I am a parent with 2 kids and can understand your situation very well"
Yo,"Hi, how are you doing?"
"I am decent. I am here because my friend talks way too much on the phone, and it frustrates me. They never want to hang up, and the talk can literally go on for hours.",It sounds like it would be quite frustrating for your friend to talk way too much on the phone.
"No, he loves it! I'm the one who hates it.",My goodness! How do they respond when you ask to end the conversation?
"I tell him, but he just doesn't get it. Or, he says he understands, but then just goes back to talking! Or, he may finally end the talk, but the next time we talk, he will just do it all over again!",I wonder what it would be like for him if you hung up the phone even after he said he still wanted to talk. Wow--that does sound annoying that he will repeat the same pattern the next time.
"He will literally talk up to 10 minutes without letting you have a word in. As far as that advice, I have hung up, but he gets extremely offended easily.",That sounds really difficult if he gets offended so easily. I find it hard to talk to some of those kinds of friends.
"I'm at my wits end. I tell him all the time. ""You talk too much. You gotta stop talking at me. You gotta give the other person a turn. You gotta respect other's time.""",What do you get out of the friendship with this other person?
"Well, I've been friends with him for a long time. He's funny and can have interesting perspectives on things. Also, we have done a lot together in the past.",That sounds like a lot that the two of you have been through. Were there other times that your friends was more equally responsive or attuned to you in conversations?
"Oh, yes, I have other friends in conversations who can take turns and understand the concept of time just fine. I just don't know what to do about this guy in particular. I still want to be his friend, but he just doesn't change.",I wonder if there is anything nice you could do for yourself when you are talking to him that would make it easier to talk to him.
Do you think I should just have a timer that goes off at 1 minute and let it beep in his face if he goes on for too long to train him like a monkey?,I can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable.
I just need a method. Talking to him is just not working. He is hard to condition.,Would it hurt his feelings to use a timer like that? It may for some other people.
"Yea, but I might be able to slip some humour in there to take the edge off because it is so silly.",Humor is really helpful for a lot of people.
Any other ideas?,"Sometimes, people draw or do something else distracting with their hands when talking to someone who dominates the conversation."
So your option is to start just doing something else when he is talking? He might get the message in a subtle way?,"Sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. And, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded. The strategy works well for me with some of my family members who seem like they will never change. But, with distraction, I enjoy them all the more."
"This is true, and it isn't bade advice. Haha! That is funny. Yes, maybe I should find something to carry around with me that I can enjoy. I don't really like to draw...",Is there anything else that you like to do that would be distracting while also letting you somewhat participate in the conversation?
"Yes, perhaps I should just use the internet when he starts talking too much. I have a phone.",That sounds really helpful. Sometimes people also play phone games or with a fidget spinner. I like your idea of looking on the internet.
"This solves the problem in person, but it doesn't solve the talks over the phone, but it has been 15 minutes now and this has been helpful enough. Thank you for your solutions. You have been very supportive and kind to me I don't want to take up any more of your time. It has been a good conversation.",You are very welcome. I wish you all the best!
Goodbye. You as well.,Bye!
good morning,"Hi , how are you?"
"tired, how about you?",Good afternoon Why your tired?
"Is it afternoon where you are? I'm still waking up, should have more coffee. And, I am just always tired, tired of everything these days","Yes , What happen why you are tired please can you explain ok , everything going ok"
I think it's my depression. I have a very hard time getting motivated to do anything. Nothing seems worth it,Please can you tell why you are in depression ?
"I have suffered with it all my life, but this past year has made it so much worse. I feel as if I have no control over anything as these stupid lockdowns go on and on and on Are you a real person?",please engaged yourself in different actives that help you come out from this depression
"I know that I need to do that, but it's pushing myself that is so hard.","yes, everyone going in this situation because of lock down"
"For sure, and I know that so many are much worse off than I.",yes i know that's hard put please try to engaged yourself in fun activates
what do you do for fun? can you give me any ideas?,"those activities that you like that you feel fun in it here is also lock down situation from log time , how is there? Why your in depression because of job or any thin else thing*"
"Same, wish I could move to another state where they have more freedoms. Also, it is still winter here so that does not help. I spend my time worrying about those hurt thru all of this...so many having depression, anxiety, increased overdoses, suicides and relapses. I have always had this depression, think it must be a chemical thing, I don't know. I just never feel happy, since i was a kid Quit my job recently because I was working helping people filing their unemployment and it was so stressful!",why please don't feel like that i hope you will come out from this very soon
I feel other's pain so much thank you :) you sound like a nice person,"yes , Thanks"
"can you tell me where you are? I am in the US, in Illinois",I'm in London
"I hope you are real. It is good to connect with someone else! Cool!!! I would love to hear your accent, lol",yes I'm real and i hope everyone come out from this
At least there is sun out today. How about there? It's been nice chatting with you. I hope you have a good day! Do something fun,"cloudy, windy as always here"
haha...sorry about that! Be safe and hang in there. It's got to get better someday. It's on the way,"Thanks , i hope i help you in all this your situation"
You have! Just to talk to someone is good. Thank you! bye for now,"your welcome, bye"
"have a nice day, and weekend....bye","You too, bye"
Hello Anyone there?,Hello there. How are you doing today?
Oh hello. I'm doing okay. How are you?,"I am well thanks, what can I help you with today?"
I came here because I am feeling quite hopeless. Life seems bleak. I feel as though there is nothing to live for and I will never be happy,"I am so sorry to hear that. I understand, things can be tough sometimes."
I don't know how to be happy What do I do Ok,"Have you reached out to people who may be feeling the same? I know that has helped me when I have felt down. It is not easy, I know, but sometimes taking a small step can make all the difference"
I don't like to bother people who are feeling the same way. I don't want to be a burden on them,I understand. Do you want to tell me more about what has been on your mind?
"Sure. Everyday feels pointless. I wake up, do nothing, go back to sleep. Even when I do things it still feels pointless. I feel like life is meaningless and I would be better off dead. I want to be happy, but I feel like I can never be happy. If I can never be happy, then what's the point of being alive?",I really do understand. It is very strong and brave of you to speak up. I have suffered depression myself in the past and one thing that truly helped was going to see my doctor and talking it though with him. He suggested medication and after some trial and error I found one that worked. You must be so strong to have dealt with the way you are feeling for so long. Please know there is help out there. I know from experience. You are a person of worth.
Oh my gosh you are an amazing person Thank you,That is very kind of you to say.
My board is going around me to my staff and I am frustrated. And angry!,I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to tell me more?
My supervisor left and she reported to the board. Now we report to them. They said they would just go to us and not them. Now the board is going around us (me and my coworker).,"I could understand how that could make you very angry, I would be too."
Have you ever ran into something like that before?,"I have not, it sounds like a very bad situation. Is there anyone you can report this to at the company?"
Not really. My coworker and I can complain but that can only go so far. I need to detach and do the work but my ego is hurt.,It sounds like you are working in a toxic work environment with poor leadership. Have you considered possibly seeking another job? Or maybe another company?
Not really. This just started happening last week. I'm still trying to get a better idea on how to deal with this.,I understand. What do you think about having a conversation with the board and let them know the issues you are having? You could have your coworker back you up.
"I think that is how I am going to respond. I am also hearing this from my staff, which may be part of the problem. I am trying not to let my ego get involved but it is hard.",It sounds like you take a lot of pride in your job which is very amiable. I think confronting the board is the best way to go about this.
I am worried that I will not be received well. Should I be?,"It's very possible, but I think you will be commended amongst your peers. You owe it to yourself not to be walked all over."
That's true... I need that at least.,"And who knows maybe the board will appreciate you coming to them, it shows great strength."
I hope so my last two days were pretty upsetting. Thanks for your help.,"You're very welcome, was there anything else you wanted to discuss?"
"No, that's all.","Okay I hope I was able to help, good luck!"
"Hello, how are we doing today?","Good, how are you?"
Not so good unfortunately.,You can tell me what's bothering you
"Due to this pandemic, I fear for the safety of my job.",Totally understand your worries
Anxiety is at all time highs due to this.,Is there a reason for your fear?
My firm has already cut 10%. I feel like I might be going next.,"it's important right now to take one step at a time, you should always prepare and find a backup plan in case it happens, but at the same time not worry too much because it won't help"
"I can't stop worrying. If I lose my job, I don't know where to go, what to do.",You should look around and see if anyone hiring I would say go for part time jobs too in case there is nothing available in your industry
"With lock downs in my area, small businesses will go under. Which means fewer jobs. I'm really scared.","You can try gig worker, being on Mturk can bring some decent money if you're diligent"
Anyone tips for Mturk? I'm new to this.,"I only work after office hours now so I aim for good paying gigs. Back when I had more time, I just did any gigs available"
Any suggestions for gig work?,"Do any work you can get, it's all about speed and willingness"
"Thanks for the positive vibes, but my future looks dim unfortunately.","I understand, it's hard to be positive right now However, I believe things will get better eventually as long as you hang in ther"
hello,"hey there, how's it going?"
alright. just getting by.,is there one particular problem or issue that's been on your mind the most lately?
I am estranged from my family and living 5 hours away from everyone I know and my fiance is away for almost 2 more years,"That sounds rough, I'm sorry. Being away from people we care about would make anyone feel pretty bad."
Yeah and I really have no friends since I quit drugs so I can't really even text my old female friends,"You don't have to answer anything you don't want, but I'm curious- how'd you end up 5 hours away from the people you know?"
My fiance's job He works out of ATL,Gotcha. That's rough for you. Sounds like you made a sacrifice to make that happen.
Yes but he is worth it.,Glad to hear that :)
I am just alone down here.,"A lot of us feel like we need friends around to keep our mood up, or to get support when we're bummed or bored or sad. Sorry to hear you have less friends nowadays. Are you interested in finding new friends?"
"Yes and no, if they are on my level then yes but if not then no. I don't want to associate with people that do drugs so its been a tough time making friends.","Yeah, that's tough. It's tough enough to make friends as an adult in a new city. Tougher still if it seems like a lot of people are into things you don't want to be around."
"Yep, so I just work at home since COVID so I don't really get out.","What's a word you'd use to describe your feelings about this issue? Sad, lonely, frustrated, etc?"
Lonely,"Bleh, sorry to hear that. And also, that makes sense based on what you've told me."
Yeah it is okay it has been nice chatting. Hopeful time will go by quickly for me. I thank you for your time. Have a good day.,"Good talking to you too. Lonely sucks, but in a way it's also okay. I hope you don't feel like you're broken or you're doing something wrong."
No just alone. I will be fine. thank you!,Good luck to you and stay safe! Have a good day.
Hello. Is anyone there,Hello. How are you today?
I'm doing good. I need some advice,What can I help you with?
"Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus",Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies?
I did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that I'm handsome. But it's starting to get on my nerves because it's all they make fun about every time they see me!,I'm sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous.
"Haha I would hope so Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus What do you think I should do then?","I understand, school was tough for me too. I suggest you tell them to knock it off or you can sit somewhere away from the bus."
Should I just beat them up with my backpack,"No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won't help."
There's another bus route. Should I just take that instead,I think that could be a good idea if it's not too far out of your way.
I think I will. Their comments make me very insecure,You could also tell a teacher what is happening. They will help you out. I bet you are handsome! Don't let it get to you.
The teacher would probably make fun of me! Thanks it's hard to look in the mirror now,Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things.
I'll try to be positive for once. Do you believe working out will help,Working out will help a lot! When I was feeling down on myself I decided to go to the gym three times a week. It was a great confidence boost.
Awesome. I will start to take care of myself and not worry about others then.,That sounds like a fantastic idea.
"I swear, I can't take these lockdowns anymore.",I can definetely understand why. During this pandemic we have been more isolated than ever It's not easy
"I mean it's one thing to limit capacities in places, but to say we're not allowed to go to our friends' and family's home is just plain ridiculous.","It is more than reasonable to be frustrated with regards to that. I myself have not been able to visit my ill mother. She lives in another country, so it's especially difficult."
"That is a shame. I mean I know people can still do Zoom or Facetime, but I imagine you can related to me in knowing that both of those options are not the same as face to face.","Exactly, the experience feels like it lacks the main connection we share with our loved ones. It is totally normal to want to be face to face instead."
"I think that's the other thing that these lockdowns are doing; they're sucking the emotional aspects out of activities and pastimes we love. Instead of laughing or jumping with fright in theaters with everyone, we now have to do it with ourselves. Rather than cheering as an audience over a touchdown, it's now a crowd of one. It just feels robotic now.","I agree with you, what used to be super-exciting activities now have a much more monotonous feeling. However, it's not the end of the world. Thankfully, researchers have just came up with a vaccine prototype I heard."
"Yeah, but even with the distribution, some people are saying that things won't return to normal till about late spring/early summer. It's certainly maddening.","I know it's not easy, but try to think of this whole situation of a challenge that you are overcoming. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. You will come out of this ready for any hardships that life might throw at you."
"I guess, I still think our responce to this was sloppy at best. I mean, lockdown the healthy masses due to a discease with a 99% survival rate? It just doesn't make sense in my book. I'm just glad this silliness will be over soon.","It will hopefully be over sooner than we think. Just try to keep a positive attitude, focus on the things you like, and time will fly. I know it can be hard, but I am sure you got this"
I think over time (sooner than later hopefully) I'll be able to get over it. Thank you very much for talking to me.,It has been a pleasure : )
Have a good day :),You too!
Hello,"Hello, how are you doing today?"
I am doing very bad,"Bad days can be rough, can you tell me more about it?"
I woke up this morning and I felt so sad and upset I cannot shake the feeling and its made me want to do nothing all day,I know I have had days like that when things seem hopeless but things always get better!
Yeah it just doesnt really feel like that right now I have so much homework and chores to get done and I just dont have the energy to do it,I know it can be overwhelming when you have so much to do but I am confident you can overcome this!
Yeah im really hoping I can Im just feeling hopeless right now is all Hopefully it will all be better soon,Have you ever considered trying to get a planner in order to schedule your time? I really think this would help you feel less stressed.
Yeah I would love that I just dont have a ton of money right now but maybe I can ask my friend to buy me one for time time being and I could pay her back,"That sounds like a great idea, having a friend like that really puts a positive spin on things. You could also consider the dollar tree, they have planners for only a dollar."
Oh thats true maybe I can walk their tomorrow It would give me something to look forward too,"I think that would be great idea, exercise and fresh air normally helps me when I have been in a bad mood."
Yeah I completely agree I think going there tomorrow will actually really help Is there anything else you want to talk about?,I am so glad I was able to help you come to a solution! You will be back on track before you know it. I use a planner myself and this is the only way I am able to keep everything done!
Yeah this for sure helped. Thanks so much,You are very welcome! I am glad I helped!
"Hi, how are you?","I good, how are you feeling?"
"I am worried that COVID-19 has made me depressed. I am usually a well mannered, even personality but I find myself impatient and possibly getting depressed.",So you think that COVID-19 has made you depressed? Could there be anything else that could be bothering you?
"Possibly... I think the remote learning of my kids and the iability to leave the house or go out, is making me sadder than normal.",I completely understand where you are coming from there. I feel like remote learning takes away from some of the social aspects of life that need to happen in order for a healthy life.
"I am also worried that I am not playing the political game well. I feel like I am too straight forward, not rude, but I should play politics more to get ahead.","I understand that as well. It seems that no matter how politically involved we are, things are always changing. Change is a good thing though as it makes us stronger as people. Do you have any hobbies/interests?"
"I agree. As I deal with more and more power, there seems to be more politics. Yes, I like to watch movies and workout. THat's about it. with a wife and 2 kids, I don't have more time.",Sometimes some of the best things we can do is t get out and away from all the things that WE as people have created. Get into the woods and throw a ball around.
That would be nice. Is that what you do when you are stressed or depressed?,"I understand, especially having the remote learning going on, it is hard to get away from work and school."
Yeah. How do you cope with your stresses? I find myself drinking more than I want now too.,"I try to, I love packing a day back with some easy snacks, and going out for a hike through the woods. Sometimes I use the state trails but sometimes I just go out and make my own new trail."
"That's fun. I try to get out once a month for a nice hike. We did the Indiana Dunes last month and that was good. With the snow coming, it might be more snow shoeing moving forward.","Well, drinking doesn't really deal with it. It only pushes things off for later to deal with. Exercising is a really good way to deal with that stress."
Yeah. I have not missed a workout since COVID-19 started. That seems to keep me grounded.,"That's true! I used to live in Ohio, and the weather was amazing this time of year."
"Yeah. In chicago, we have a lot of snow but also some good state trails. It's been helpful, especially when this first started. I live across the street from a forest preserve, which was a life saver.",Are you able to do more workouts? Sometimes I have found that running (which I hate doing) makes me feel so much better in times of high stress. Running also releases endorphins into the body which will help to alleviate some of the drinking/stress.
I am trying to do more. I work out daily and that isgood but I am trying yoga for the second workout. Thanks for your help.,Is there anything else I can help you with?
I hate how some people voted,Why do you feel that way?
because if biden really does win he's gonna fuck with everyones gun rights,You seem really concerned about gun rights. Does that sound possible?
i am an army veteran i defended the county and risked my life. i want to defend my children and my home how that i am back in country,"Thank you for your service. I can understand how that might be a difficult situation for you, especially with your experiences. How are you handling this situation?"
thank you. i'm just really worried. my neighbor is a single woman. last month her boyfriend beat her up and she called the police. it took 35 minutes to respond i have an 8 year old daughter and five year old twin boys. i want to protect my children from harm,"You are welcome. That is really kind of you to want to protect your children from harm. It seems like you feel the best way to do this is through owning guns? Have you thought of any alternatives, since the votes have been cast?"
what alternative? the police are so backed up everywhere they can't respond fast enough. they should be our first line of defense here in the us against bad guys but that doesnt happen or they ccant always be trusted to respond quickly and efficiently so i feel we have to take it upon ourselves. if someone were to break in and has a gun.... i mean.. criminals dont get guns the legal way anyway you know. what should i do...throw a knife at them? lol,"That is a good point you bring up about the quickness and efficiency of protection that guns can provide. How you thought of any other alternatives that could help your family, regarding the process of obtaining guns during a Biden presidency?"
not a clue. do you have any suggestions?,Definitely! My first step would be understanding the gun policy that Biden would have and confirming the new process. Does that sound like something that could be a good starting point?
true..i may be worrying over nothing,I think you are just being careful and protective of your family. That is very honorable of a veteran like yourself.
thank you i guess going to war makes you worry about things a lot of people dont normally have to huh,"Yes, that sounds like the case. Are there any practices that have helped you when you're worried?"
"well...the va has me do jornaling, deep breathing and mediation. kinda embarasing to admit...","Don't be embarrassed! To be honest, I have had experiences with some of those, including deep breathing. I also find it helpful."
thanks for sharing. that makes me feel better. :),Of course! I am glad to share and help :)
I'm glad we talked. I. hope you have a great day and a great. holiday season!,Yes it was nice. I hope you have a great holiday season as well!
Hi,Hello how are you? how may i help you today?
Kinda sad today Wanted to ask for some mental support,what is making you sad?
Not being able to find a job after graduation,I can understand how you are feeling i had the same problem after i graduated
okay,have you put in job applications everywhere
"Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much",With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job
yes,you are right. Have you looked on the internet such as indeed?
I've tried LinkedIn they have many companies hiring maybe my CV is just bad,yes they do i am familiar with that how is your resume looking?
I think I could improve it,Have you talked to someone in your family and see if they could help you with your resume to improve it
"I've asked some friends, I think a friend will help me out when he's not busy",do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient
Yes I know,have you tried to go to place and talk to a hiring boss about a job?
It's hard with this virus to go anywhere pretty much,yes i can understand that.
Worst time to graduate Haven't even got the graduation ceremony lol,all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen
Yea that's what I am thinking of doing,good thing is you graduated and congrats on that
yes at least I graduated haha thank you,your welcome hope my suggestions helped you today
thanks a lot (15min is minimum ) you made my mood go up,i am glad i could help you
Have a great evening and thanks for suggestions :),you do the same and no problem :)
I was reallly worried in this suitation,"Hi, i'm sean, hows your day going"
Was not so good,Tell me about the situation.
How was your day,Boring.
It really very stress full and depressed situation. Why your day is boring,"Don't worry about my day, i'm 34 and retired i do this to help people, tell me about your situation."
My suitaion is really very sad and depressed,I was a homeless drug addicted junkie for over 10 years. Tell me how yours is worse sweety. Tell me why you are so sad and depressed.
"I had breakup with my partner ,it was really very horrible to me to overcome .","Was he abusive, tell me more."
I tried a lot but i couldnt forget him at all He was not abusive at all,So what was the problem? Tell me more. I can't help you if you don't talk to me darling'
i was really a bad suitation i am stressed and depressed right now .,Tell me about it. with covid-19 yout not alone. what was it about your situation that was so bad? did you lose your job? why are you so stressed? lack of financs. depresseions because of lack of job finances etc... lover?
yes i am alone i didnot lose my job i had a break with my partner so i am stressed i am want to over come my stress and depression what can i do for it,"put on a fancy dress, nice makeup, do your hair, and go to a classy bar."
k i will do it,take a man home with you.
in this can i overcome the stress,I guarntee your depression will be gone and the anxiety will take some time.
thank you for the suggestion,"you never know, the man you meet might sweep you off your feet and put a ring on your finger."
it will be really good miracle thank you bye,your welcome have a good night.
How do you become happy? How do you find something worth living for?,"Hi, I think there are a lot of ways to become happy and to find something worthy living for. Let's start with things that interest you. What do you like doing for fun?"
"I don't really know anymore, nothing makes me happy these days. I used to like reading a lot but it's become a chore.",And what kinds of things did you like to read?
"Mostly fiction books. Fantasy, historical novels, contemporary fiction, anything really.",That's really great! I used to struggle with finding joy in reading as well. I was a graduate student at the time so I was mostly reading research papers.
Do you like reading again? What helped?,Have you tried picking up a new hobby? Something you have always thought might be fun but haven't ever tried because of lack of time or energy?
"I wanted to try rock climbing, but I don't know. I'm not really in the best shape.","I do like reading now. I took some time after school to take care of my mental health by going on walks and being in nature. Overtime, I started to pick up books again. I've found I really like true crime and autobiographies the best"
I feel like people will just make fun of me.,"Rock climbing is so fun! Have you tried taking a beginners course? I started there. I was very nervous I would be made fun of, but found that it was a really supportive community."
I guess I can give it a try. But I don't know if it will be enough.,"You might find it's just the community of people that you need right now. From my experience, they were all super friendly and open to helping me along the way."
"I guess you're right. I tend to get caught up in my own thoughts, which never have anything good to say about me.","Just from chatting with you, you seem like such a nice person. I don't think anyone would have mean things to say about you."
That's kind of you to say.,I really hope you'll take the leap to trying rock climbing! It was so fun for me when I did it and I can't wait to get back out there to learn more (hopefully COVID will be over soon!) :-)
Yeah I think I'll check if any gyms are open right now and try a class.,That sounds great! Hoping they are open and safe!
Hello?,hello. how have you been feeling lately?
Tired I want to sleep all my problems away,how long has this been going on?
Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two I got a hold of a therapist but they won't talk to me for two days,that's very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out.
"I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge","have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night?"
I can't sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it's typically late afternoon,it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that.
thank you i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over.,it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible?
yes it may be. i'm not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking.,you're under a lot of pressure. it's only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you're doing the best you can.
thank you. that is very supportive i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster,perhaps you can spend some time doing pleasant things. it is true that time seems to go fast when we're having fun.
that's true. i thought about maybe playing video games,fantastic! that's a great way to spend your time.
maybe overwatch i haven't been playing them much,"i'm wondering: are you a reader? do you enjoy reading? i'm asking because i find when i read a good book, time seems to move very quickly."
i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late.,"perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then,if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter."
that's a great idea. that may help a lot with focus.,personally i love reading; especially non fiction. what type of books do you enjoy?
dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction.,i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors?
lauren destefano her series the chemical garden trilogy is my favorite,has she written anything you haven't read yet that you think you would enjoy?
that's also another good idea. i haven't read all of her bookis,do you live near a library?
i do but they're closed because of covid,"there may be some libraries in your area that are open, or have reduced hours."
i can try the bookstores are open,wonderful! do you live near a book store?
sorta but not that close but i can take the bus out there,you can call the store and see if they have anything written by your favorite author.
that's a great idea,"getting back to the sleep issue, have you considered thinking some pleasant thoughts before going to bed?"
i try but i get too stresed,i can understand that. the stress is interfering with your thoughts but you are still doing a good job. you are doing the best you can do; that's the best anyone can do.
thank you. that's true.,"i'd like to offer a suggestion. please try, as best as you can, NOT to think about the sleep issue. millions of people have sleep issues. you are not alone. try thinking about other things, and if your mind comes back to the sleep problem, try thinking about something else."
thank you i will take that advcie,and make sure you are not hard on yourself. you're getting by. you're hanging in there. you are doing well under the circumstances.
Good afternoon.,How are you feeling today?
I am feeling okay how are you?,I am glad to hear that I am fine as well. How can I help you?
Thank you. That is good. I feel I am depressed because I have been bullied and it is still continuing today.,I am sorry to hear that. How can I help you deal with the bullies? Can you stand up to them in a safe way?
"Well, to be honest, dealing with these bullies are pretty tough, Is there a safe way I can handle them?","I understand your concern, but I feel you have to tell them that you do not deserve to be bullied and they need to stop now."
"Okay. I will do that. Thank you. Also, what if one of the bullies starts a fight with me?","Do you need any more advice on this matter or do you have any other concerns? The bully is the problem, not you. Do you have anyone who can stand up to them with you for support?"
I do. One more piece of advice before we part ways. I have my fiance for support. I would want to know how I can stand up to these bullies.,Have your fiance approach them with you so you are safe. Be strong and firm and do this in a very public area if possible so you have witnesses. Do you have a meeting place where you feel safe?
Yes he has. I will thank you. Yes. We are meeting in a park and I have people who are coming down.,I hope this is all behind you soon so you can feel better.
I will thank you so much for your help.,When will this meeting take place?
Today at 5 pm.,Please take care and stay safe. Are you nervous?
I will thank you. I am but I think I will be alright.,I am so glad to hear this. Good luck!
Thank you!,You are welcome!
Have a great day!,You too!
Hello,Hello
Hi,How are you doing today?
selling all my stuff to move out of the house. Trying to get some short term cash Couldn't pay my rent,I know that moving due to a lack of funds can be extremely hard. I'm sorry you are going through that.
I am not moving I won't have a home in 2 days,I apologize. That is much harder situation. Are you unable to fight it due to the COVID-19 moratorium on evictions?
"No, since too much time has passed",Have you tried any local churches or agencies? findhelp.org is also a great resource.
I am just glad I don't have any children...too hard for them to live on the streets I am going to go out looking today. my Internet gets cut off today,There should be funds to provide you with a hotel. Please check into that as well.
Where can I get those?,I would call the local social services department. The money was allocated to try to stop the spread of the virus. findhelp.org may have information as well.
Do you know how much it is?,There should not be a cost to you.
"I mean, how much money do they provide?",I'm not sure.
I will start researching it now. Thanks for the info.,"My pleasure. I hope you can find some assistance. If nothing else, call you local health department and/or local church."
hello,"Hi, how are you?"
i feel anxious,"That sounds rough, do you know what triggers your anxiety?"
I have a large test coming up for school,So it's the test anxiety that has been causing the stress.
"yes, definitely","I had a lot of anxiety before exams when I was in school, too."
how did you manage stress,I tried my best to get more sleep and I studied earlier so that I didn't panic at the last minute. That made it slightly less stressful.
"that is what I try to do, I also exercise to relieve the stress the sleep part can be difficult",That is great! Exercise is supposed to help a lot with stress and anxiety.
Do you have any suggestions to improve sleep the night before?,"Many studies have shown that melatonin is a safe and effective sleep aid. Boring podcasts are good for sleep, too."
I've tried melatonin - hit or miss. I haven't thought of podcasts - maybe I will try that,"I can relate to the problems with sleeping and test anxiety. I know that if you try a few things to see what works for you, it will get better."
thank you! luckily exams don't last forever,Good luck on the exams- you can do it! :)
thank you for your suggestions - which podcast do you recommend I try,"I like ""Sleep with me"" and ""Anxiety Slayer""."
"The names sound like they would be helpful, I will look into them - thanks!",You're welcome! Bye
Hi,"Hello, how can I help you today?"
I'm really stressed with school exams and I'm struggling with anxiety,"Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed?"
"I have 3 big exams coming up at the same time, and they're all really important for my final grade. I know I'm going to badly because I haven't been learning well during the pandemic","Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse. Currently, on a scale of 1-10 how well are you understanding your course material?"
"Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can't make any progress studying.",That's completely normal you haven't made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on!
I guess so. But if I fail or do badly on my exams it's really not going to be good. I'm on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3.0 gpa,Would you say your problems start with your roommates?
"They're the biggest problem right now. But I think having to learn from home is the main problem. It's so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. No library, no office hours, no study groups.","I completely understand, the same goes for me. It can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line"
Are you a student too?,"Yes, and I completely get it! Its so hard to self-manage without the right resources"
"Yeah, I wish the professors and university would be more flexible When the pandemic first started, we didn't have grades, and that was really helpful","Ah and then they started rolling in, correct?"
"Yeah, even though nothing has really changed I feel like until way more people get the vaccine, we're still in the pandemic","Me too, unfortunately for us, universities don't seem t have the same sentiments. For starters, I think it would benefit you to eliminate the more closer problems: your roommates Have you tried talking to them?"
"Thanks for that suggestion. I have tried, but they are immature and just want to party. I've started staying in my room which helps, but is very isolating. I wish I could afford my own place","Makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. I can see your dilemma Are you currently working?"
hello,How can I help you?
I'm have recently lost my job and I am scared about the future and how I will cope.,I am so sorry to hear that. I have previously lost a job and I know how distressing it is. Can you tell me about it?
I just feel very worried. There are no other jobs around and I don't know how I will provide for my family.,So you are feeling as though you are letting your family down?
Yes.,I can understand how that feels. Have you tried to talk to them about it?
"Yes, but there are no real solutions. I don't know what to do.",Do you feel as though you are going through all of this on your own?
"Yes, a bit. It's scary not knowing what is going to happen.",Do you know that there are people out there who can help you? Have you tried contacting some charitable organisations that will provide counselling for free?
No I didn't know. That sounds helpful.,They can be really very helpful. I have reached out to them myself previously
"Ok, thank you. I will see if I can find some local to me.",The job market is very uncertain right now but please know that you are not alone!
"Yes it's very uncertain, and very scary to experience.",Have you considered retraining?
I think I'm too old for that.,There is no such thing as too old! I have a friend who trained as a teacher at age fifty.
Maybe I should explore what options there are.,There are a lot of options out there. Perhaps you should see a career advisor?
"Yes, that's a good idea. Thank you.",Do you have any ideas of things that you'd like to do? Do you have any ideas of things that you'd like to do?
I think I will speak to a charity about if they can help. I will think about talking to a career advisor and retraining. Thank you for your help.,So you feel that you could retrain?
Maybe. I will need to give it some thought.,"I know how frightening it can be. But if you strike out there, you never know!"
Thank you. I guess I have to try.,Well if you don't try you will never know what might have happened. I wish you all the very best with it.
Thanks again.,You are most welcome. Is there anything else that I can help you with?
Hello,"Hell, How can I help?"
"I'm ashamed of how I look which makes me anxious when I have to attend zoom meetings, I have to leave my camera off. It feels like cheating! I am badly in need of a haircut due to the pandemic...my short layered hair is now shoulder length shag lol...I hate the way I look right now and it gets me down.","Initially, I used to feel like that and never shared my camera but I know I can do all the time."
oh really? how long did it take you to get up the nerve....its been months and months of mic only for me lol...and the silly thing is the people i'm zooming with aren't particularly attractive so I shouldn't feel ashamed.,When I saw many people were sharing camera and they didnt care about anything - few sitting in room full of mess but they dint care.
in person i am much more confidant...would like to care less. care less about being on cam i mean some people look so comfortable and relaxed! I just get seized up with anxiety,correct - it is just our mind thing which stops us not to share but once you start sharing you will feel confident. Once you dont care what people think you will be more confident. You will also be used to it
maybe i should take the plunge...it seems so silly to me because logically i am not in these meetings to impress anyone maybe i'll pick the least threatening meeting and start there...one that's a smaller group,You can also try different backgrounds in Zoom which will improve the way you will look.
oh really? I haven't experimented with that. maybe I can get a friend to practise that with me that's a good idea,Correct - you can start with your colleagues and then slowly you will start sharing in other meetings. no problem - practice always helps. Start small and then go big.
its hard I'm getting older now (50's) and its hard seeing my appearance go downhill. But at least it's happening with my other friends too lol. Gravity is a bitch! what age group are you in?,I am nearly 50 as well. People over 50s looks better and I am sure your appearance is good as well. It is just thinking.
"hmm yes....my attitude and self defeating thoughts....i need to work on that, thank you for your encouragement",It is all inside and outside appearance doesnt matter
You know you're right there,All people over 50s are graceful - honest opinion.
"maybe it's like a lot of things for me, that always seem worse until i try them, then i'm like ""what was I so worried about""","No worries about anything and enjoy life. 100% agreed - Initially, all looks difficult but by the time all becomes easy and we become so used to it."
"first world pandemic problems lol i can't wait to have meetings in person again, so much better than zoom",yes this will be over soon and we are also used to it.
"but i'm grateful we have zoom in the meantime, zoom's better than a conference call",100% agreed - In person is always way better than remote
"amen to that....it being over soon....we have all had to be so very patient thankyou for your help today. so I will first practise with a friend, and play around with backgrounds. then I will take the plunge in a low-key small meeting and see how it goes",I am sure it will be under control before end of 2021 - Optimistic.
"yes me too :) ok thank you again, stay safe and be well. appreciate your help! bye",we just have to wait and follow all the guidelines.
indeed,pls let me know if you need any help on sharing camera
Hi can you help me with my problem?,Hello. What's on your mind?
I'm disgusted with my friend for cheating on her boyfriend. Am I right to feel this way?,"Your feelings are valid, no matter what they are. Why do you think you're disgusted with her?"
Because she's not acting the way she should be acting. Her boyfriend is a nice guy so he doesn't deserve this treatment,"It sounds like she did something you find really immoral. Is their relationship generally pretty good, to your knowledge?"
"Yeah, but I'm also thinking it's not my business. I should just stay out of it. Well I thought it was good until that happened. He doesn't know. So I just feel gross around them.",Have you talked to your friend about what she did?
"Yeah, she doesn't really care because she's not going to tell him. I'm questioning whether I should still be friends with her.",You're definite right to be questioning if this is the sort of person you want to be friends with.
It's hard to stop thought because we work at the same place. though..,"If her behavior is getting to you like this, I definitely suggest you try to keep some distance from her as much as you can."
"Yeah, I've been trying to, but she's always talking to me","It might be a good idea to explain why you're upset with her, even though that's likely to upset her."
"I guess, but I'd rather just avoid her. I'm thinking if I ignore her then she she'll get the hint",I can definitely understand wanting to avoid a confrontation.
"Yeah, I realize she's quite selfish so confronting her wouldn't help.",What do you think you can do to minimize your contact with her?
Just not respond to her messages and avoid the areas she's in,That sounds like a good plan.
Is that ghosting?,"What one person calls ghosting, someone else can call looking out for yourself. It sounds like she knows why you're upset with her and would be able to understand why you're choosing not to talk to her. If she's not interested in listening to you or thinking about what she's done, then you need to be doing what is best for you in cutting her out."
Hello. Feeling low today.,Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it.
"I've been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn't go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction.","yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?"
"Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions.","Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress."
"Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face-to-face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way.","Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now.What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing."
"Thanks. It helps to know that I'm not alone. Most often, I work independently my work. Involves a lot of explaining and justification. Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together.","My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don't convey the meaning 100 percent."
"So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues?","I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven't already done so."
"Ah, something more casual?",Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work.
"That's a great idea! I would love to get a care package, actually!","Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body. It doesn't have to be hobbies of our own, but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale."
"Thank you! I will suggest that my organization arrange these. We can even ask all the employees to showcase their hobbies, or some such. I will pass these suggestions on! Have a great holiday season!",That is good to hear. I am aware that the other team in my company all read a book called How to Be Antiracist. It can serve as both learning and bonding purposes. I am glad that I can be of help. Thank you again for reaching out. Hope you adjust better to the changing norm next year and happy holidays.
Good evening,Hey there! How are you feeling?
I am very angry and not sure if I should feel that way my husband tells me what to do where to go and when to go but he says hold on please got go for a min,"Correct me if i'm wrong, but it sounds like your husband may be controlling you a little and you're expressing reasonable emotions because of it. and Okay!"
he said if he were controlling i would be givign him attention read between the lines than he will say don't touch this like a cheesecake and than tell me week later make it,Why do you think he talks to you this way?
I am going to write stuff to move it up on screen . he might come read this so if isuddently leave i a m very sorry My friends say because i allow him to control me and,Okay that is perfectly okay. You are fine. If you need me to assist you in any way just send a question mark.
dont stand up for myself and lalow him to treat me that way I am angry too because I cant be free and express how I really feel he has a disrespect i think for women in general and call them cunts ? question it wont let me just send aquestion mark,"I've been in a similar situation. I was with someone who was controlling in a lot of aspects so i can feel your pain and struggle. I can feel your anger too, and I imagine that it is alot. It is not your fault, and you aren't allowing this to happen to you. It is out of your control. Don't ever blame yourself. How can I assist you?"
That makes me feel better. How long were you in relationship,I was in it for two years before I broke away from it. It was so hard but liberating to leave!
ok I am glad for you..,"I could suggest you see a private doctor to talk about this with, if that is something you are able to do. Or see one with your husband. Maybe he needs a third party to help mediate the problems you guys are having."
he will not go to therapy nor am i allowed I am lucky to have family friends whom I can talk to,That's very hard to deal with. And I am so sorry you are dealing with this. Do you feel safe?
but he thinks he is always right and blah blah blah yes My real concern is for the boys . they see him treating me this way and will think its ok they even said something disrespectful to me and hubby was like you don't talk to your mom that way or ill knock your teeth out he wouldnt but he doesnt see how its his fault,I can tell this situation stresses you out and probably consumes a lot of your day to day energy. I sympathize with you and your children. What happens when you try talking with him about this?
he says i m making a mountain out of a mole hill and i have no idea what controlling is,I commend you for speaking up for yourself despite his responses. I hope you hold on to that strength for as long as you can. It will empower you
well boys need to get ready for bed . thanks for listening. You can know I will be safe.,Okay I will be praying for you and I hope the best outcome for you possible. Please know there are domestic hotlines you can call if need be. I hope you enjoy your night.
you too keep safe,Thank you!
Hi there.,hi how are you today? How can I assist you?
"I'm feeling really stressed. I'm about to graduate from college, but my last two classes are killing me. I keep having dreams that I've been forgetting to go to a third class and now I won't graduate. It's keeping me from being able to concentrate on the real classes.",It seems you are working really hard and in stress due to your classes.
"Yes, I am working really hard.",The good part is you are giving your best and keep doing it. don't think too much about the result. These kind of dreams are the worries inside you.
It's hard not to think about the result when the stress is interfering with my studying. I don't know how to manage the stress.,I can understand the situation you are going through. You are working hard and keep doing it and try to mediate for few minutes in a day. Hope that will release your stress.
"Okay, meditation. I can do that. But what else can I do?",When I am in stress I do mediation and it gives me relaxation and a new way to think. sometime our body and mind need peace to work better.
"I've never meditated before. I'm not sure how. I even worry about meditating, my goodness.",Mediation is just to concentrate on your breath. There are so many videos on internet. You can take short break when you feel exhausted and talk to friend and family for a while. It will help you.
"Okay, I'll try that. Hopefully it helps. I'm just so worried about graduating now that I'm so close.",You will graduate with flying colors. My best wishes are there with you. stay focused and calm. That's the mantra. Hope you will achieve whatever you want. Best wishes!
"Thank you! I'm so close to getting my degree, and it's been a long time coming!",Is there something else that I can help you with? The time will go fast. don't worry
"I know, only two months left! And I only had two classes left this semester, so maybe that's why I keep dreaming I've forgotten a class. Did you have a similar experience sometime?",You can do it I am pretty sure. Keep working on your goal. I had such kind of anxiety when I was in college. The best way to come out from it is to stay focused and calm.
It does make me feel better that it's a pretty universal feeling.,"yes, It happen with all human being I believe."
"Hello there. In the past 3 years, I have gotten into 2 car accidents. Neither of them were my fault. I sustained a concussion/traumatic brain injury and am experiencing depression and PTSD. I have nightmares of crashing at least 2x a week. I am seeing a therapist, but due to the pandemic we are not meeting in person to do EDMR for my PTSD","Hello, I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like an awful lot to go through in a few years time, which now can feel like the time passes so quickly."
I have a traumatic brain injury that creates a lot of overstimulation in my life. I used to be social and now I can't be in a social setting for too long without feeling exhausted,Have you tried to talk to your therapist through video chat or is that something they offer?
"Yes, I talk to my therapist every other week","That's great that they can offer that, I know it's very difficult to get regular care at the moment with the pandemic. Do you have any family or friends close by or something that you can talk to if you feel like you need some extra support?"
"I do not have supportive or understanding friends and family I have lost a lot of them in the last few years or have created boundaries because when I got into my first car accident, legit someone said ""are you not better yet?"" and another said ""can't you just walk it off?"" When I got into my second car accident, people said ""again? are you drunk?"" Even though neither were my fault, people were not understanding or asked how scary those situations for me were","I am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way."
"After my first car accident, the tow truck guy was towing my car to my aunt's garage to hold for auto insurance appraisal. He said to my aunt ""sorry for your loss"" My aunt said ""oh, she's right over there and alive"" the car accident was so bad the tow truck guy thought I had died but even after seeing my car, friends and family acted like it was just something that happens to everyone. walk it off","Wow, I can't imagine what the car must have looked like then for such a comment to be made. I'm glad that you here and despite going through that trauma that you are still going."
Thanks.,"A women fell asleep at the wheel in 2013 and hit me going through an intersection and totaled by car as well, but I had only had a concussion and pain I had to go to physical therapy for a short time, so I can't imagine how you must have felt."
What are some things you do when you have depression? Have you been in a scary car accident before or know anyone? Have you offered them kindness or you just dismissed them and thought it was their own problem? That sounds scary. And is extremely unfortunate.,I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed.
"Absolutely! But I'm doing better now. You find out who your real friends and family are and you move on. The whole saying of ""they don't deserve you at your best when they weren't there when you were at your worst""",You are 100% correct. Have you looked into any support groups at all or tried to connect with anyone with similar experiences through social media?
"I don't use social media I quit in 2016, which is also when I started realizing how vain people are Some of those same friends and family didn't bother to text me even though they had my number I did find a local group that did social stuff together but they were all really old like 50 years plus I'm in my 20s so it was hard to relate",Gotcha! Well I'm glad I was able to connect with you this evening because sometimes it helps just to chat and have someone listen :-)
Thanks! I appreciate it. Happy Holidays and Happy New Year,I hope that for 2021 things can somewhat go back to normal so the routines can get back to what they were and that this next year is your best year yet. You have already been through so much to be in your 20's.
Hello,Hi! How are you today?
I'm grounded so i'm not happy,I'm sorry to hear that. It must be hard. Can I ask what has happened?
My sibling broke the tv and blamed it on me and my parents believed them,"Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. That must be a hard situation, to not have your folks believe you."
It is very frustrating,Have you spoken with your sibling about why they lied?
"No, we just got into a yelling fight about it and are both in our rooms now",I'm sure it's frustrating when you know you're correct and no one believes you.
Yes it is I'd rather just run away from everything,"It's not cool that you're sibling lied, but it may be a good time to breathe a second. Running away never solved anything"
It is late at night,"So probably it's quiet. this is a good time to take a breath and , literally try and sleep on it. What do you want to see happen?"
that is probably a good idea. I want my sibling to be punished not me and for parents to believe me,"OK, I understand. So, then, it's how to figure out how to make that happen."
well my parents dont believe me so not much i can do,May I ask why they believe your sibling? Is your sibling a different age?
they are younger and the favorite,I understand.
I just need to wait until I'm 18 so I can move far away,"So, it sounds like you already have a plan to turn things around. How far away from 18 are you, if I can ask?"
1 year,"OK, good for you. It may not seem like it, but you can do anything for a year."
True. I can't wait,"So, the question is....how do you deal in the short term?"
It will be nice to get away and never talk to family again Just hole up in my room and not talk to anyone from now on I think only talk when necessary,"Yes. I was going to suggest the ""grey rock"" technique. You would be only as polite as you need to be, and only engage others in a limited way. You go about your business as you need to without the involvement of your other family members."
That is a good idea I will just do that i can handle that for a year thank you for your help,"you're welcome! I truly wish you the best. Stay calm, you're a stone, and will get through this until you can leave."
"Hi, how are you?","Hi there! I'm great, what about you? How can I help today?"
My girlfriend dumped me for someone else! I've been really shook up.,I'm so sorry to hear that :( Do you have any idea why?
I think she just lost interest in me? It happened a couple of months ago. I wish I could get over it. I can't get her off my mind. She's dating this total loser.,That's tough... so you're saying that you grew apart a little? Or do you think it was more one-sided?
It probably was more me than her. Maybe I should have done more to show her that I cared for her. Am I not romantic enough? Some guys just aren't that way.,"I completely understand, and I don't think you should beat yourself up over it!"
"That's a fair point. I shouldn't be too hard on myself. I didn't really grow up in a romantic family. I don't know how to do that stuff, but maybe I could learn.","Exactly, and remember everyone is different, perhaps you just weren't her right one, and that can go both ways. Do you want to improve for her? or for yourself do you think?"
"That's true. I really got hung up on her. I thought she was perfect and that we were perfect together. She didn't see it that way. I can't really change who I am, and she couldn't change who she is. I don't know if I can change myself for her. Maybe there is something basic that she wants that I just don't have? I should probably change for future relationships.","That's a great line of thought, its good that you're able to identify that yourself"
What do you think I could do to improve myself?,"I suggest that you stay exactly the way that you are. I feel like you'd be happier that way and also more likely to find someone who shares the same values as you If you change who you are, it sort of means that your ex still has a hold on you, you know?"
Will the same problems show up in the next relationship though? It could be a long search before I find someone that matches with me? That's true. But I feel like I should take away something from this experience.,"I guess that depends on you, would you rather compromise for a relationship or find one who'll really last and not have to change?"
I think all relationships require compromise and change. No two people are perfectly compatible. I worry that I have blind spots that I should fix. My ex-GF didn't really specify what the problem was.,"That's true, building on that, you could also say that what your ex found to be the problem is not the be-all end-all. What your ex disliked could be what 10000 other girls love in a guy"
"That's true. I might end up trying to solve a problem that really isn't there. It's not a bug, it's a feature! :-)","Wow, you put that really nicely!"
Thanks! You’ve been really helpful today. I can’t thank you enough for your encouragement and insight.,It was no problem! Thank you for sharing and talking it out!
I feel a lot better now. Have a great day! Bye!,Have a great day :) bye!
Hello,"Hi there, how can I help you today?"
"My friend has been quiet and non responsive for some time and I'm starting to worry about them. This is a pretty recent thing, ever since lockdown.",Is this a close friend of yours that you would normally speak to every day or see on a regular basis?
"Yes that's correct, however with lockdown I haven't seen any friends for a long time face to face.","Ok so you have are close friend, who you used to engage with regularly and now you are worried because when you try and contact them, they aren't responding."
Yes that's the issue. I think lockdown is affecting people in many ways and I want to make sure they are OK,I can tell that you feel a lot for your friend and it shows that you care about lot about them.
Yes I do. Now what should I do about them as other friends in our peer group are also concerned?,"Ok, I understand. Have you tried reaching out to their family members as they may have a loser handle on how this person is feeling at the moment?"
I actually haven't. I'm not that close to their family to be honest so I'm not quite sure how to do that?,"You could try reaching out to friends on Facebook or social media, you can find contact details for them that way and perhaps send them a direct message. You are a concerned friend which means they probably wouldn't mind if you did get in touch."
I didn't think about contacting family that way. That's a good suggestion.,I had a friend once that was acting out of character. They weren't quiet but I could tell them here was something different in the way they were acting etc. It turns out that they had started a new relationship with another friend of mine and didn't want anyone else to know. In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end.
Perhaps I am worried about nothing and your experience does make sense. I may be reading too much into these things but you read about people's mental health being affected by COVID isolation these days.,"That is true. Mental health issues have increased significantly since lockdowns began As they are not responding to your attempts to get in touch, you could think has anything else changed for them other than lockdown, for example are they busier at work? have childcare commitments? Life is complicated, they may not have the time for legitimate reasons."
That is true. I think they are probably very busy at the moment but as they are typically so outgoing it did strike me as odd. What else would you suggest?,"You mentioned that other friends were also concerned about them, have you tried talking to them about setting up a video call with a group. This might appeal to your friend and they may see this as a fun activity to get involved in."
I think I'll give that a try. Maybe they don't have time but a fun relaxing group chat might be the way forward. Thanks for this suggestion. I'll give this a go.,No problem happy to help.
hi anyone there?,"yes, hello how are you today?"
"hi, I am okay, but am very frustrated at how often i procrastinate stuff i need to or want to do it's hard to even get started sometimes, i think it's pandemic frustrations","I understand how you feel, I also procrastinate...I have found if it takes less than 2 minutes to do it, I go ahead and do it, it takes some of the stress off."
hmm so you prioritize the quick tasks?,"this pandemic most definitely has caused frustrations for everyone yes, it makes the list of things to do a little shorter and not as overwhelming"
"i think when I can GO places to do things with other people it will be easier to be motivated/active i have tried breaking jobs down into smaller tasks that does help, you're right on that but it breaks my heart that i have not touched my art and sewing! i had all this ""extra"" time over this past year, and couldn't crack into it have you any other ideas?","of course! i got into puzzles...and games with my little one helped pass the time also, taking walks gets you that breath of fresh air that is sometimes needed"
"i live alone, but have played some online games with my sis. Walks are good but I can't walk with my friends (we are on a stay at home order presently) and I find it hard to motivate myself when it's just me but i agree walks are really helpful, when i get out i really enjoy them. Okay that gives me some good things to try out, thank you for your help today",i understand that.
where are you located?,"anytime, hope you stay well united states- louisiana"
"Im in ONtario CAnada....thank you, you too! bye for now.",bye!
hello?,How are you doing today ?
stressed,"It is a stressful time , why are you feeling stressed ?"
"work, kids, school",I can understand
how many kids do you have? what kind of degree do you have?,"I have 2 kids , How many kids do you have ? I have a bachelor degree"
6 year old twin boys and an 8 year old daughter i'm divorced. they sleep at his house and he gets them off the bus i start work at 6 so i cna get off at 2 and get them off the bus at 3 i'm going for my master's degree. i am about halfway done,"Managing things all become stressful, but Im sure you are really good at what you are doing!"
im so tired all the time i feel lik everything i do just isnt enough how do you handle things and stress?,"Thats are not true, You have beautiful kids, work and pursuing master's . You are a great achiever"
i guess,Deep breaths and practicing mindfulness will help you relieve some stress
I WISH I HAD TIME LOL,I sometimes do Meditation or go for a 10 mins walk
i guess it is worth a try anythign else? *anything,Thats true with your busy schedule finding the balance is challenge .
"i am a multitasking queen, but even then i still dont have enough time it seems lol",Hope you feel relaxed just chatting with me for a change
hi,Hello!
I'm dealing with a lot of frustration and anxiety.,How are you?
Frustrated and anxious,Oh I understand how that can be. Would you like to tell me about it?
"Ok. I have a friend who I've known a long time, who is one of my closest friends, but who is extremely insecure. She constantly seeks affirmation that I love and care for her, even though she should KNOW I do, since we have been friends for so long.",I can understand how that can become a source of frustration after a while. Would you like to share what pushed it beyond the normal point today?
It's just been an ongoing thing that has escalated recently because she's so afraid and timid and doesn't believe anyone could really love or care for her. I get sick of having to say that of course I love her.,I can relate because I also have a close friend that seeks constant reaffirmations. Have you spoken with her about this?
"I have. I address it every time it comes up. She always sells herself short. Recently I suggested she could babysit my kids, she agreed, then almost immediately said it was ok if I had someone better in mind, and didn't want her, even though I had asked her! do you talk to your friend about it?","Sometimes it is very difficult to see yourself through someone elses eyes when you undervalue yourself. I know it may be difficult to remain patient when your friend repeatedly does this, but maybe you could explain to her that it makes you feel like she is mistrustful of your opinion when she second guesses your taste in friends."
"Yes, I know. Until she finds her self worth, it doesn't matter what any of her friends say to her. I have actually told her that. That it seems like she doesn't trust me.",Possibly explaining it in a way she can relate to would be helpful. I did in fact speak with my friend and it helped our relationship quite a bit. We continue to be very close 20 years later.
"It's frustrating to me and gives me anxiety because I wish I could change her to see herself the way I, and others, do. But I know I can't make her see her self worth. That's something she has to find for herself. That's good to hear about you and your friend.","I can feel your frustration just by our conversation, and I too wish that she could see that you value both her and your friendship enough to reach out to someone that can just listen. Don't forget that your feelings are valid as well."
"I know they are. And yes, she's dealing with a lot, but we all are, and it would be so much better for her if she could trust the people who love her to actually love her.",Sometimes you have to take a step back and fill your own cup.
Indeed. Thank you for your input.,Do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship? Do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship? It has been my pleasure! I trust you will make the right choice! Best of wishes!
Hi. How are you doing today?,I am doing pretty well. There's a beautiful sunset outside right now. How are you?
Good to hear. Stressed and anxious nowadays due to this pandemic.,Yep. Me too. My dad just got sick and I was worried out of my mind waiting for his test results to come back. Thankfully they were negative. Is there anything else you've been worried about?
Sorry to hear that. Hopefully it works out. Job stability is a concern of mine.,Are you working right now?
"Yes, but my firm has already cut 10%. I feel like I would be next.",Do you have a backup plan if you get laid off?
Currently no. I am only a low level employee. This is what I am fearful of.,"I see. Do you have anyone who would be willing to offer you support if you needed it, like your parents?"
"Yes, but it will probably be minimal. I fear the economy will be in a downturn due to this lock down in my city.",It might be worth talking to them ahead of time. I'm sure they would understand. Lots of people are in a similar situation right now.
"Ok, that is very helpful. Is there a lock down where you live?","Yes. I live in California, which is kind of strict."
"Oh, I am from Oregon. That is understandable.","I'm perfectly happy to be at home, though. I'm on break from school and I have plenty of projects and stuff to work on here. I really sympathize with everyone who has to support themselves right now, though. It majorly sucks."
Good to hear. Are you on holiday break?,"Yep. I'm off for a whole two months, because my school didn't want anyone coming back after Thanksgiving."
"Oh ok. Well, thanks for your insights. Take care.","Also, I know I don't really know you, but can I write you a Christmas card? If you would rather not give out your name/address I totally understand. :)"
Hi,Hi How can I help you
I am not happy. I lost my job.,"Oh, thats bad. When you lost your job?"
about 4 months ago.,In which field you are looking for?
Bus driver and/or Production,You can try as a school driver. As school now opened You will get it
That is what I did do but with union rules and bidding rights. There is not enough work,Try Uber and that is good choice as you are not doing anything.
I tried but my cat is not new enough for their rules.,Oh ok Take deep breath and just keep applying.I am sure you will get something good. Believe in god!
God has been my source of comfort he's my everything!,That's really good. Keep trying your best . Apply everyday for job. You can start with grocery stores . I am assuring you that good time will come soon.
Than-You it's is good to talk about this I feel better. I will try to go to grocery stores maybe even can do deliveries. Are you there?,yes
I am not so sad not . I will look for other suggestion you gave me. I cannot get unemployment because I only worked part-time,That is nice to hear from you. I thinks you are happy now
Hello.,Hello! How are you doing today?
"I'm not doing very well unfortunately. I failed my college finals, and now I'm up for Academic Probation.","I am so sorry to hear that, I'd love to understand more about what you are struggling with?"
I'm almost near gradution too.,Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Academic probation does seem very scary. When did you learn you failed your finals?
I learned yesterday. Because of the pandemic the semester is shorter.,And how long do you have until graduation?
I should be graduating in June.,"I see. Well it's nice that we matched up! I actually work at a college and now a couple good strategies to get off academic probation, and or avoid it! What is it you are studying?"
You're a great resource then! I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in Biology.,Oh that is awesome! So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation?
Likely in the next week. I registered for my classes for next semester but I think I should drop my minor. \,"Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation"
That's great advice and likely would be my best option. I will definitely do that. I feel better hearing that it's okay to drop my minor. I felt like a failure when I considered it.,"From talking with you so far, I can tell that you are stressed about this. But I want to reassure you that your mental health should always come first. It is the most important thing you can do."
Yes I am very stressed. I hate taking online courses and this pandemic is wearing me out. Plus I have a 2 year old son.,"You are definitely not a failure in the slightest! In fact, I would argue that you are the exact opposite of that. Being able to take such difficult courses in a pandemic, and raise a child shows how strong you are!"
"Thank you for saying that. It is tough, but I just want to finally finish my Bachelor's and do something positive.","And you will succeed in that goal. You have the motivation and the care for it, you just need to focus on managing everything at once! Have you thought about meeting with an academic advisor and laying out a plan?"
"I am always angry at myself and others. I lose my temper constantly and say very racist things. I need help with my anger. I am upset that the Presidential election is being stolen from President Trump. I say racist things about it, and punch myself in the head or bang my head into the wall when people disagree with me.",Where does your anger stem from ?
I think it is because people disagree with my politics. I am sick of being discriminated against because of my skin color.,Its ok to disagree with people about topics but you need to figure out why it triggers so much anger which turns to hate
"Half my family is Puerto Rican, I am White. All the Puerto Rican family members consider themselves to be allies of the blacks, I do not. I have been repeatedly victimized by black people,",How have you been victimized by black people? When those events happen how did that make you feel
"I have been robbed at gunpoint three times in the past 8 months while walking home from work. Each time, it was one or more black males with guns who robbed me. They would call me racial slurs every time too. Also, my wife was raped by a black homeless man in July 2020 while she was jogging in the park. This made me get so angry, that I burned down a low-income housing building that was occupied by only black residents. I tried to get even with the blacks for what happened to my wife. I can't seek help with a professional for my anger issues, because I have committed violent crimes to get even with my oppressors. Are you going to help me?",I see I too have had my issues with other races. A few bad instances do not make represent a whole race though. There are also black males who have been robbed and jumped by white people that does not mean all white males are bad. It does seem that you have had alot of unfortunate events with black males. That still does not mean that all black people are bad and why should innocent people pay for things others have done. Do you have to walk home from work or can you drive. Also have you reported any of these events to the police.
"I walk home because my job is only a mile away. I live in a predominantly black area. The police have taken reports, but candidly admitted to me that nothing would happen as far as arrests because of the current ""woke"" climate.",I understand have you ever thought about if that black man that raped your wife was just getting even with the white race because his wife or maybe even him was raped repeatedly by white supremists
"It upsets me, the way I feel. I do have 2 or 3 black neighbors who are decent people, but thats it. I am the only White person on my street. I am constantly taunted by the blacks in my area. No black woman has been raped by a white man in recent history, even DOJ crime statistics back me up on this one. When is the last time anyone remembers a pack of white men raping a black lady? I just want to not be scared around here anymore. I am sick of being victimized. They are pushing me over the edge.",My suggestion would be to get out of the area if is just triggering your anger. Are you able to move to another area?
"I can move, but it would be very costly. And I don't want to move now because it is winter and it is cold and we have over a foot of snow on the ground.",I would suggest for your mental health when the weather is better to move and until then I would avoid areas that can potentially be dangerous and also don't walk home after dark. Also you need to keep seeking council for you anger and racial feelings. I would suggest when you feel very angry to take a deep breath think will your actions help or hurt the situation. To help with racial issues I would like you to sit and talk to black victims who have been victimized by white people in violent crimes.
I appreciate this advice. It does seem good. I just want everything to get better.,If you follow my advice I think you will see a great improvement. Your willingness to seek advice and ability to identify that you have a problem is a big first step all you got to do now is put the solutions into practice.
Do you think that maybe I should go to church or something to help?,Church is always a great idea. I think church would be very helpful. Maybe someday you should even consider going to a predominantly black church.
I would consider it. There is actually a black church 3 or 4 blocks from here. The people there are undoubtedly as nice as anybody else im sure.,Maybe you should try it out maybe meeting some good black people there would ease your hate against black people and also help your experience in the neighborhood.
Thank you. You have been helpful,That is what I'm here for. If you ever need anything else don't hesitate to reach out and good luck. I know you are going to do great and be just fine.

Its very depression situation because of Covid lock down I'm taking new courses to get new job but market situation is very difficult,taking new course is a good idea
Yes but lets see it will help me to get new job or not,"yea, market is very bad and difficult right now but if i can get a job just last month then you can get one too yea, market is very bad and difficult right now but if i can get a job just last month then you can get one too"
Thanks for your support,if the course is in relation to the kind of job you wand then go ahead. that is a good thing to do
lets see how long is going this crises situation I try to continue to take these course but its difficult to manage this situation,"Hello, are you still there"
yes I'm just thinking about how i can get new job Are you there?,"you should check for job vacancies in your state, and also let your friends be aware because you don't know where the connection might comes from"
Hello,"Hi, how are you?"
"I'm alright, thanks But I am a bit worried about the academic pressure I am facing","Would you mind possibly telling me a bit more about it? I am not all that familiar with that, and it does sound intriguing."
I have not done very well in my exams and i'm worried about what my parent's reaction will be when they find out,"I tend to worry at times too, and it almost always helps to talk about it with someone. Do you usually get along well with your parents?"
"I agree, thank you for being open to talking to me Yes, I do, but they have invested a lot in my education And I feel that I have let them down","It sounds to me like you're thinking that you've disappointed your parents by falling behind in class a little? I felt much the same way back when I was in college. My parents paid my way through school, and even got me to pursue a major that I had no interest in."
"Yes, that is exactly how I feel My parents came from quite a rough background too, and they have sacrificed a lot to get me here","I can tell you from personal experience and seeing others who've gone through similar events, your parents just may be a little upset right now, but they love you and really just want you to have a good and happy life. It sounds cheesy, I know, but it is actually true."
"Thank you, I hope so :)","I know it may sound silly, but you may want to start meditating on a regular basis. It truly does make a big difference in the amount of stress and worrying that you will find yourself not doing nearly so often."
"I've had other people say the same, thank you for the recommendation I'll give it a try tonight","Studies on the benefits of meditation, mindfulness, and yoga have been pretty definitive in the fact that it drops people's stress levels, and thus their cortisol levels, and makes a real change for the better. I do it myself and it really has worked well for me. That's great! You'll be so glad that you did, I just know it. Please make sure you get back in touch with me to let me know if it was beneficial for you as well. You might also want to consider having an honest conversation about this with your parents. Are you able to have conversations like that with them?"
"I will definitely try and have a conversation with them (after some meditation, of course!) Thank you for talking to me over these past 15 or so minutes :)","You may be surprised at how understanding parents can be when you open up to them Thank you for sharing with me, and I truly hope that it has helped you even just a little. Thank you for sharing with me, and I truly hope that it has helped you even just a little."
