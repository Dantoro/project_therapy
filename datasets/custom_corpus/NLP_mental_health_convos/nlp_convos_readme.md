**Description:**
This dataset consists of 3,512 real or anonymized mental health-related conversations, formatted as pairs of “Context” (typically a user’s input or question) and “Response” (the reply, often from a therapist, counselor, or support agent).

* Each row represents a single call-and-response exchange.
* The “Context” and “Response” columns are both plain text.
* Some rows may have missing responses; these can be skipped or used as single utterances.

**Intended Use:**
For** ****word2vec** training:

* Extract both “Context” and “Response” as separate utterances to expand your clinical dialogue corpus.
* Suitable for training domain-specific embeddings that capture language and phrasing unique to mental health support settings.

**Notes:**

* This dataset is real or human-authored, not synthetic or generated by AI.
* Always review the dataset’s license on Kaggle before any commercial or published use.
* Useful for tasks such as chatbot development, dialogue modeling, and NLP research in the mental health domain.
