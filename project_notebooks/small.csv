We were all Fucking Dead!! ðŸ’€Everyone was laughing like dying hyenas and the teacher asked him to turn off the mic and tell his name and Guess What? He fuckin Did It! ðŸ˜¶but he was not from our college so that's that. We legit laughed about it for like half an hour. The teacher had a pretty hard time tho, poor guy",non-suicide

At last, while I was arguing with them finally another friend was like "" he just didn't go out one fucking time stop already it's not nice"".
While I'm happy for that, bc some other things happened too they said that we would all meet up on the weekend. One of my 'friends' said that he didn't want any friendships to be destroyed but like 10 minutes after in a group call he was saying that I said things that I didn't and he was making fun of me.
You don't want any friendships to be ruined but then you proceed to be an asshole, yeah ok",non-suicide

62279,"I'm not okI haven't been OK in a good 2.5 years now. How long am I supposed to hold onto the idea that shit gets better. The only people in my immediate life that I am near, in person, are my coworkers. Family ditched me, wife left me, and my 3 best friends, too. I can't do this anymore. I can't keep waking up, trying to find a will to subject myself to the risk that I'll lose more in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of what I lost was because I'm trans; some of it was because of the depression I suffered from having family leave me for being trans, and towards the end - I just started pushing people away in self defense because I guess... I figured it'd hurt less, if I pushed them out before they walked out. Y'know?

I find distractions over and over to carry me forward, but nothing sticks; and if I don't have one, I usually end up crying hysterically and reminisce on my life pre-transition. It's a horrible duality; I miss what I had before, but I couldn't not transition. I just can't 'not' be trans. I keep thinking this is some shit nightmare, and I'll eventually wake up - and my life will be as it was before. Mother who loved me, siblings who chatted with me often and we'd host hangouts, my wife and I still married. I'm so, so tired of losing; and even more tired of fighting.

I've had my method of leaving ready for about 6 months now; I was supposed to go on my 32nd bday. I dont know... I'm sorry; thank you for reading.",suicide
