       "      <td>Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to \"snap out of it\" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC</td>\n",

When I work with those that are experiencing concerns related to feeling of depression and issues with self esteem. I generally work with my client to help build coping skills to reduce level of depression and to assist with strengthening  self esteem, by guiding my client with CBT practices. CBT helps with gaining a better awareness of how your thought process influences your belief system, and how your beliefs impact your actions and the outcome of your behaviors.  This process isn’t easy but it helps teach an individual that we don’t always have control over what happens in our lives but we can control how we interpret, feel, and behave. CBT is good for individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, toxic relationships, stress, self esteem, codependency, etc.</td>\n",

I'd look at finding what is going well in your life and what you can be grateful for. I believe everyone has talents and wants to find their purpose in life. I think you can figure it out with some help.  \n",

When I work with those that are experiencing concerns related to feeling of depression and issues with self esteem. I generally work with my client to help build coping skills to reduce level of depression and to assist with strengthening  self esteem, by guiding my client with CBT practices. CBT helps with gaining a better awareness of how your thought process influences your belief system, and how your beliefs impact your actions and the outcome of your behaviors.  This process isn’t easy but it helps teach an individual that we don’t always have control over what happens in our lives but we can control how we interpret, feel, and behave. CBT is good for individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, toxic relationships, stress, self esteem, codependency, etc.  \n",

To then go and cause them embarrassment is unconscionable. The entire job of a parent is to prepare their child to become a successful, healthy adult. You do this by using healthy ways to teach a child when they make a mistake. Discipline shouldn't be seen as punishment. It should be seen as a way to teach a lesson. What lesson could this possibility be teaching him? Absolutely nothing. Meanwhile, she is most likely damaging her relationship with him and causing great distress in his school day and peer interactions. She should be one of the people he can come to when he's hurting; not someone who causes him pain.</td>\n",

       "3507                              Absolutely not! It is never in a child's best interest to use humiliation as punishment. This can lead to issues in the relationship between parent and child as well as the child's social relationships. Kids have a hard enough time. To then go and cause them embarrassment is unconscionable. The entire job of a parent is to prepare their child to become a successful, healthy adult. You do this by using healthy ways to teach a child when they make a mistake. Discipline shouldn't be seen as punishment. It should be seen as a way to teach a lesson. What lesson could this possibility be teaching him? Absolutely nothing. Meanwhile, she is most likely damaging her relationship with him and causing great distress in his school day and peer interactions. She should be one of the people he can come to when he's hurting; not someone who causes him pain.  \n",
       "3508  I'm sorry you have tension between you and your bf.A relationship means two people who relate, right?!   If only one person does all the work to change their approach, what they expect, what they offer the other, then this becomes the new problem to solve.If you've already done a significant amount of reflection and change in the way you relate to him, then the next step may be to be patient as long as possible while he decides what to change about his part in the relationship toward you.Substance abuse recovery requires profound effort and reflection.  If it is successful then the result will show very different qualities in your bf than the ones you know currently.He may be so absorbed in the recovery that he can only concentrate on this.   Of course if the fights persist and you have been patient for what feels too long, then there are different questions to address.  \n",

He may want to work things out or he may be done. He may be done for a short period of time or be done forever. No one can answer that which is why I think you should change the focus. If you do get back together, will you still trust him to not leave you? What if he does not love you? If you never get back together, can you still have a healthy, happy life? Can you mourn that relationship but also learn from it?I want you to be strong, happy, and healthy with or without him. So yes, there is hope for you - with or without him.</td>\n",

Instead, its when you follow up by inquiring and listening to others that you  may discover they feel and think and struggle just like you do. And as a result, you discover you really were never alone; when people discover common struggle and feelings, we are connected.  Second, we as humans are sometimes feeling alone because we may be lacking some self-acceptance.  Not fully accepting myself or situation , can be in the way of feeling the presence of others or the hearing the voice of others too. Or in other words, not bein 'ok' with myself makes it difficult being with others.  Third; feeling alone may be us not clear on what we are really needing from another person?   These are just some thoughts to consider.  Aloneness feels so real; and yet it has much to do with our perspective and view of things...  we are all alone in a crowded world until we speak and listen more closely.Kindly-keith hughes M.A.  keithcounseling.com</td>\n",

I'm curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you \"should be\" - What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man \"everything else is perfect about him\". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thanks for asking this question. I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. For that reason, I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.As far as telling girls or keeping it a secret, I don't really think that it's necessarily one or the other, at least not the first time that you meet. In other words, one part of your decision-making could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date, or perhaps something that you address after you've known each other for a couple of meetings. The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating. I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this. It sounds like this is an important part of you, so I would think that if you were going to date someone long-term, you would want them to know about the most important parts of you, including that.I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this, that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing, but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to cross-dress.I'd also ask you to consider this: Are the people who you say this to expecting it? My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that, Are they going to have questions? I would imagine so.Are you comfortable answering questions?I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends (or perhaps even with a therapist) how you would answer these sorts of questions:What exactly is cross-dressing?Does that change the gender that you're attracted to?What does it mean to you?Why is it important to you?And what you want your listening person to know about you related to cross-dressing.There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.I certainly hope that you find the right person for you. I imagine that having this conversation could be stressful, especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past. Remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful.</td>\n",

Studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor.  Trust your instincts and if you don't feel comfortable, let him or her know that you don't think it's a good fit.  Many counselors list on websites like Psychology Today and Good Therapy.  Visit these websites to learn more about therapists in your area.</td>\n",

Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust.

I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.\\n   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?   \n",

We cannot control him, his actions, his love, or his decisions. But we can work on you. Think about a few things: What do you want? What do you love about him? What made you two separate? What do you think about being in a relationship where your partner does not love you? Does that seem fair? He may want to work things out or he may be done. He may be done for a short period of time or be done forever. No one can answer that which is why I think you should change the focus. If you do get back together, will you still trust him to not leave you? What if he does not love you? If you never get back together, can you still have a healthy, happy life? Can you mourn that relationship but also learn from it?I want you to be strong, happy, and healthy with or without him. So yes, there is hope for you - with or without him.  \n",

Instead, its when you follow up by inquiring and listening to others that you  may discover they feel and think and struggle just like you do. And as a result, you discover you really were never alone; when people discover common struggle and feelings, we are connected.  Second, we as humans are sometimes feeling alone because we may be lacking some self-acceptance.  Not fully accepting myself or situation , can be in the way of feeling the presence of others or the hearing the voice of others too. Or in other words, not bein 'ok' with myself makes it difficult being with others.  Third; feeling alone may be us not clear on what we are really needing from another person?   These are just some thoughts to consider.  Aloneness feels so real; and yet it has much to do with our perspective and view of things...  we are all alone in a crowded world until we speak and listen more closely.Kindly-keith hughes M.A.  keithcounseling.com  \n",

I'm curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you \"should be\" - What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man \"everything else is perfect about him\". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love.  \n",

       "2642  Thanks for asking this question. I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. For that reason, I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.As far as telling girls or keeping it a secret, I don't really think that it's necessarily one or the other, at least not the first time that you meet. In other words, one part of your decision-making could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date, or perhaps something that you address after you've known each other for a couple of meetings. The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating. I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this. It sounds like this is an important part of you, so I would think that if you were going to date someone long-term, you would want them to know about the most important parts of you, including that.I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this, that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing, but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to cross-dress.I'd also ask you to consider this: Are the people who you say this to expecting it? My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that, Are they going to have questions? I would imagine so.Are you comfortable answering questions?I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends (or perhaps even with a therapist) how you would answer these sorts of questions:What exactly is cross-dressing?Does that change the gender that you're attracted to?What does it mean to you?Why is it important to you?And what you want your listening person to know about you related to cross-dressing.There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.I certainly hope that you find the right person for you. I imagine that having this conversation could be stressful, especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past. Remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful.  \n",

Studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor.  Trust your instincts and if you don't feel comfortable, let him or her know that you don't think it's a good fit.  Many counselors list on websites like Psychology Today and Good Therapy.  Visit these websites to learn more about therapists in your area.  \n",

Differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict. I would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that isn't as arousing as is possible. There are some good videos on this resource page about sexuality and intimacy and a video that specifically addresses desire differences in relationships.   \n",

Counseling is a process, whereby you and your therapist will help you create goals- starting with issues that are most pressing and interfering with your daily functioning. When anxiety and daily stress is more manageable then you and your therapist can examine more deep rooted or more chronic issues.  \n",

The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior. The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior. Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust.

What you are describing is being in a state of shock. You haven't suddenly become a sociopath - this is a normal reaction to an event that is completely overwhelming. There are most likely too many feelings to feel right now, so your body in its wisdom is shutting them down. You absolutely can recover, and it would be really important to get some trauma counseling with a counselor who feels safe for you to talk with. This is not the kind of situation to try and handle totally on your own.  "

It's been a challenging journey, and it's commendable that you've tried various approaches like visualization, positive thinking, and medication to manage your symptoms. However, it's clear that these methods haven't been effective for you. It's essential to acknowledge that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and what works for one person might not work for another. Today, we're going to approach this differently. We're going to identify a specific concern related to your mental health that you'd like to work on, and we'll break it down into manageable steps. We'll define the problem as a feeling of being overwhelmed by your thoughts and emotions, and we'll set realistic goals for managing this feeling. We'll explore the root causes of this confusion, such as past traumas, current stressors, and any underlying psychological conditions. We'll also examine your thought patterns and emotional responses to these triggers, and we'll develop strategies to challenge and reframe negative thoughts. This process is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and it's designed to help you face your challenges more effectively by changing the way you think and feel about them. Let's begin by discussing the specific incidents or concerns that have been contributing to your feelings of confusion and chaos. We can explore these further and come up with strategies to help you manage them.</td>\n",

Additionally, I see that your anxiety levels are significantly impacting your ability to focus on self-care.

It's important to remember that anxiety is a normal response to stress, but when it becomes chronic and interferes with your daily life, it can be debilitating.\\n\\nOne approach to managing anxiety is through cognitive-behavioral techniques. This involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, or cognitive distortions, that contribute to your anxiety. For example, you might be thinking things like \"I can't do this,\" or \"I'll never be able to handle this situation.\" These thoughts can create a cycle of anxiety and make it even harder to focus and be productive.\\n\\nAnother approach is through relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation. These techniques can help you manage your physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a racing heart or tense muscles, and can help you feel more calm and focused.\\n\\nIt's also important to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax. This might include things like reading, taking a walk, or practicing a hobby. By taking care of yourself, you'll be better equipped to manage your anxiety and be more effective in your role as a helper to others.\\n\\nLastly, it's crucial to set realistic and attainable goals for yourself. This means identifying what you can realistically accomplish, given the resources and constraints you have. And remember, it's essential to distinguish between facts and assumptions when setting these goals. For example, instead of assuming that you can't do anything about the situation, focus on what you can do and set goals based on that.\\n\\nIt's also important to acknowledge and address any obstacles that might be preventing you from achieving these goals. By identifying and addressing these obstacles, you'll be better equipped to make progress and feel more in control of the situation.</td>\n",

It's been a challenging journey, and it's commendable that you've tried various approaches like visualization, positive thinking, and medication to manage your symptoms. However, it's clear that these methods haven't been effective for you. It's essential to acknowledge that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and what works for one person might not work for another. Today, we're going to approach this differently. We're going to identify a specific concern related to your mental health that you'd like to work on, and we'll break it down into manageable steps. We'll define the problem as a feeling of being overwhelmed by your thoughts and emotions, and we'll set realistic goals for managing this feeling. We'll explore the root causes of this confusion, such as past traumas, current stressors, and any underlying psychological conditions. We'll also examine your thought patterns and emotional responses to these triggers, and we'll develop strategies to challenge and reframe negative thoughts. This process is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and it's designed to help you face your challenges more effectively by changing the way you think and feel about them. Let's begin by discussing the specific incidents or concerns that have been contributing to your feelings of confusion and chaos. We can explore these further and come up with strategies to help you manage them.  \n",

Balancing caregiving responsibilities with personal relationships can be a delicate dance, and it's common to encounter resistance when setting boundaries.

       "2  I can see that you're dealing with a great deal of anxiety and that it's impacting your ability to focus and be productive. It's important to remember that anxiety is a normal response to stress, but when it becomes chronic and interferes with your daily life, it can be debilitating.\\n\\nOne approach to managing anxiety is through cognitive-behavioral techniques. This involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, or cognitive distortions, that contribute to your anxiety. For example, you might be thinking things like \"I can't do this,\" or \"I'll never be able to handle this situation.\" These thoughts can create a cycle of anxiety and make it even harder to focus and be productive.\\n\\nAnother approach is through relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation. These techniques can help you manage your physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a racing heart or tense muscles, and can help you feel more calm and focused.\\n\\nIt's also important to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax. This might include things like reading, taking a walk, or practicing a hobby. By taking care of yourself, you'll be better equipped to manage your anxiety and be more effective in your role as a helper to others.\\n\\nLastly, it's crucial to set realistic and attainable goals for yourself. This means identifying what you can realistically accomplish, given the resources and constraints you have. And remember, it's essential to distinguish between facts and assumptions when setting these goals. For example, instead of assuming that you can't do anything about the situation, focus on what you can do and set goals based on that.\\n\\nIt's also important to acknowledge and address any obstacles that might be preventing you from achieving these goals. By identifying and addressing these obstacles, you'll be better equipped to make progress and feel more in control of the situation.  \n",

I'm also worried about the financial burden of his care and the potential impact on my own finances. I've been trying to process these feelings, but I can't seem to shake them.</td>\n",
       "      <td>It's understandable that you're feeling a range of emotions, including guilt and worry, in the aftermath of your uncle's passing. Grief is a complex and multifaceted experience, and it's common to feel a sense of responsibility or regret when a loved one passes away. Your concern about the financial burden of your uncle's care is also a valid one, as caregiving can be a significant financial strain. It's important to acknowledge and validate these feelings, while also exploring ways to manage them effectively.\\n\\nOne approach we could consider is mindfulness meditation, which can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions without judgment. This can help you develop a greater sense of self-compassion and acceptance, which can be beneficial in managing feelings of guilt and regret. Additionally, we could explore strategies for managing the financial burden of your uncle's care, such as researching available resources, creating a budget, and seeking out financial assistance programs.\\n\\nAnother approach we could consider is cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can help you challenge and reframe negative thoughts and beliefs that contribute to feelings of guilt and worry. For example, you might be able to reframe your thoughts about your role in your uncle's care to focus on the things you were able to do for him, rather than the things you couldn't. We could also explore ways to challenge the belief that you're solely responsible for your uncle's financial care, and explore alternative sources of support and resources.\\n\\nUltimately, the goal of our sessions would be to help you develop a more comprehensive understanding of your emotions and experiences, and to explore strategies for managing them effectively. This would involve a collaborative and empathetic approach, grounded in professional ethical standards and informed by key concepts in counseling psychology, such as mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and self-compassion. I'm here to support you in any way I can, and I believe that with a thoughtful and compassionate approach, we can help you navigate this challenging time.</td>\n",

It's important to acknowledge that these behaviors might provide temporary relief, but they can ultimately contribute to increased stress and negative emotions. It's essential to recognize that these patterns are not sustainable and that they can negatively impact your overall well-being. I want to assure you that you're not alone in feeling this way, and that seeking help is a courageous step towards healing.\\n\\nYour history of anxiety and depression is significant, and it's essential to address these underlying issues to prevent a relapse. In the past, you've tried therapy, and it didn't seem to help. However, it's essential to remember that every person's therapeutic journey is unique, and what worked for others might not work for you. It's crucial to find a therapeutic approach that resonates with you and that addresses your specific needs.\\n\\nOne approach that might be helpful is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors. Another approach is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which can help you develop skills to manage stress and anxiety through mindfulness practices. It's essential to work with a mental health professional to determine which approach is best for you and to develop a personalized treatment plan.\\n\\nRemember, healing is a process, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself.

However, it's essential to recognize that these feelings don't define your role as a parent. Instead, let's explore ways to reconnect with your daughter and repair any perceived damage.\\n\\nFirst, we can practice self-compassion and acknowledge that everyone experiences grief differently. It's essential to recognize that your focus on your own feelings doesn't diminish the importance of your role as a parent. Second, we can work on open and honest communication with your daughter, expressing your feelings and concerns while also listening to hers. This can help you both better understand each other's perspectives and begin the healing process.\\n\\nLastly, consider engaging in activities that strengthen your bond with your daughter. This can be as simple as sharing a meal, watching a movie, or even just having a heart-to-heart conversation. By focusing on the positive aspects of your relationship and taking steps to repair any perceived damage, you can begin to move past these feelings of guilt and neglect.\\n\\nIn this therapeutic approach, the counselor acknowledges the patient's feelings while also offering practical steps to address the underlying issues. The counselor's response is grounded in the principles of counseling psychology, including self-compassion, open communication, and the importance of repairing relationships. By offering a compassionate yet strategic response, the counselor helps the patient begin the process of healing and moving forward.</td>\n",

Last time she stayed with me, it was a much nicer experience as there were fewer stressors. But this time, with the death of my grandpa and other changes, she's been more stressed and it's affecting me negatively. I'm finding it hard to enjoy her company and I just want some space.</td>\n",

The stress that your mother is experiencing is palpable, and it's understandable that her distress is spilling over into your living space and affecting your relationship with her.

The memory of a more peaceful time when she stayed with you serves as a poignant contrast to the present situation. It's natural to crave that sense of tranquility and to feel frustrated when it's elusive.\\n\\nIn response to your concerns, I'd like to propose a few potential strategies for managing the current situation. First, let's explore the possibility of creating routines and structures that can help reduce stressors for both you and your mother. This might involve setting aside specific times for quiet activities, establishing clear boundaries around communication and personal space, and prioritizing self-care practices like exercise, meditation, or hobbies.\\n\\nAnother approach could be to focus on effective communication. It's essential to express your feelings to your mother in a compassionate and understanding way, while also being open to her perspective and needs. This might involve having a heartfelt conversation about the impact of her stress on your relationship and finding ways to support each other through this difficult time.\\n\\nLastly, it's worth considering the possibility of seeking external support for your mother. The loss of a loved one and other life changes can be incredibly challenging, and professional counseling or therapy can provide valuable tools and resources for managing stress and grief. By offering your support in this way, you might find that the overall living arrangement becomes more enjoyable and beneficial for both of you.\\n\\nUltimately, it's important to remember that everyone deserves compassion and understanding, especially during difficult times. Let's work together to find ways to navigate this complex emotional terrain and create a more peaceful and supportive living environment for both of you.</td>\n",

It's important to acknowledge that these behaviors might provide temporary relief, but they can ultimately contribute to increased stress and negative emotions. It's essential to recognize that these patterns are not sustainable and that they can negatively impact your overall well-being. I want to assure you that you're not alone in feeling this way, and that seeking help is a courageous step towards healing.\\n\\nYour history of anxiety and depression is significant, and it's essential to address these underlying issues to prevent a relapse. In the past, you've tried therapy, and it didn't seem to help. However, it's essential to remember that every person's therapeutic journey is unique, and what worked for others might not work for you. It's crucial to find a therapeutic approach that resonates with you and that addresses your specific needs.\\n\\nOne approach that might be helpful is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors. Another approach is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which can help you develop skills to manage stress and anxiety through mindfulness practices. It's essential to work with a mental health professional to determine which approach is best for you and to develop a personalized treatment plan.\\n\\nRemember, healing is a process, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself. It's okay to ask for help, and it's essential to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. Together, we can explore the root causes of your anxiety and depression and develop strategies to manage your symptoms and improve your overall quality of life.  \n",

It's common for individuals to experience complex emotions during times of loss, especially when it comes to our relationships with loved ones. However, it's essential to recognize that these feelings don't define your role as a parent. Instead, let's explore ways to reconnect with your daughter and repair any perceived damage.\\n\\nFirst, we can practice self-compassion and acknowledge that everyone experiences grief differently. It's essential to recognize that your focus on your own feelings doesn't diminish the importance of your role as a parent. Second, we can work on open and honest communication with your daughter, expressing your feelings and concerns while also listening to hers. This can help you both better understand each other's perspectives and begin the healing process.\\n\\nLastly, consider engaging in activities that strengthen your bond with your daughter. This can be as simple as sharing a meal, watching a movie, or even just having a heart-to-heart conversation. By focusing on the positive aspects of your relationship and taking steps to repair any perceived damage, you can begin to move past these feelings of guilt and neglect.\\n\\nIn this therapeutic approach, the counselor acknowledges the patient's feelings while also offering practical steps to address the underlying issues. The counselor's response is grounded in the principles of counseling psychology, including self-compassion, open communication, and the importance of repairing relationships. By offering a compassionate yet strategic response, the counselor helps the patient begin the process of healing and moving forward.  \n",

It's not uncommon for children to take on this role, especially when they don't receive the emotional support they need from their parents. This can lead to feelings of resentment and exhaustion. In our sessions, we can explore how this dynamic has impacted your life and relationships. We can also work on developing healthier communication skills and setting boundaries to help you manage your emotional energy more effectively. Additionally, we can explore the concept of forgiveness and how it might apply to your relationship with your father. This doesn't mean excusing his past behavior, but rather finding a way to release the emotional burden that comes with carrying these feelings. This process can be challenging, but it's an essential part of healing and moving forward.  \n",
       "6309  Your words paint a vivid picture of the complex emotional landscape you're navigating right now. The stress that your mother is experiencing is palpable, and it's understandable that her distress is spilling over into your living space and affecting your relationship with her. It's important to recognize that the circumstances surrounding her stress are beyond her control, but it's also crucial to acknowledge the impact it's having on you. The memory of a more peaceful time when she stayed with you serves as a poignant contrast to the present situation. It's natural to crave that sense of tranquility and to feel frustrated when it's elusive.\\n\\nIn response to your concerns, I'd like to propose a few potential strategies for managing the current situation. First, let's explore the possibility of creating routines and structures that can help reduce stressors for both you and your mother. This might involve setting aside specific times for quiet activities, establishing clear boundaries around communication and personal space, and prioritizing self-care practices like exercise, meditation, or hobbies.\\n\\nAnother approach could be to focus on effective communication. It's essential to express your feelings to your mother in a compassionate and understanding way, while also being open to her perspective and needs. This might involve having a heartfelt conversation about the impact of her stress on your relationship and finding ways to support each other through this difficult time.\\n\\nLastly, it's worth considering the possibility of seeking external support for your mother. The loss of a loved one and other life changes can be incredibly challenging, and professional counseling or therapy can provide valuable tools and resources for managing stress and grief. By offering your support in this way, you might find that the overall living arrangement becomes more enjoyable and beneficial for both of you.\\n\\nUltimately, it's important to remember that everyone deserves compassion and understanding, especially during difficult times. Let's work together to find ways to navigate this complex emotional terrain and create a more peaceful and supportive living environment for both of you.  "

       "      <td>Your concern for your mother's wellbeing is a natural response to her current situation. It's understandable that you'd want to ensure she's receiving the best possible care given the high-risk environment of the hospital. However, it's essential to remember that healthcare professionals, including nurses, often face immense stress and emotional burden in their work. Their reactions, such as laughter, might not always be a reflection of their feelings towards your concerns but rather a coping mechanism to manage their emotions. I encourage you to continue advocating for your mother's care while keeping an open mind about the nurse's intentions. It might also be helpful to gather more information about the hospital's policies and resources regarding patient care and infection control. This will not only help you feel more informed and empowered but also provide you with valuable knowledge to share with the nurse. Remember, clear and respectful communication is key to ensuring your mother receives the best possible care.</td>\n",

       "top     Your concern for your mother's wellbeing is a natural response to her current situation. It's understandable that you'd want to ensure she's receiving the best possible care given the high-risk environment of the hospital. However, it's essential to remember that healthcare professionals, including nurses, often face immense stress and emotional burden in their work. Their reactions, such as laughter, might not always be a reflection of their feelings towards your concerns but rather a coping mechanism to manage their emotions. I encourage you to continue advocating for your mother's care while keeping an open mind about the nurse's intentions. It might also be helpful to gather more information about the hospital's policies and resources regarding patient care and infection control. This will not only help you feel more informed and empowered but also provide you with valuable knowledge to share with the nurse. Remember, clear and respectful communication is key to ensuring your mother receives the best possible care.  \n",

       "      <td>I've been struggling with my husband's memory loss and the fear of mental confusion, but it's becoming a daily issue now. He can't remember what he did just minutes ago, and it's problematic. I thought he'd had some breakfast, but when I came down, I found a half-eaten sandwich on the counter, and he had no recollection of eating it. I'm worried about the relief I'll experience as a caregiver, but managing his pain is a concern as well. I'm working with the hospice nurse on that, but I'm hesitant to use oxycodone due to its terrible side effects. I don't want him to be in pain, but I'm unsure of how to make the call when to add it into the situation.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Your concerns about your husband's memory loss and the challenges it presents for both of you are valid. It's essential to acknowledge the emotional toll this situation is taking on you as a caregiver. The fear of forgetting important tasks or mismanaging your husband's care can be overwhelming. At the same time, it's crucial to prioritize your husband's comfort and well-being. While it's natural to want to alleviate your own suffering, it's essential to remember that managing your husband's pain is an integral part of your role as a caregiver.\\n\\nIn terms of pain management, it's essential to consider the potential benefits and side effects of various medications. Oxycodone, while effective in managing intense pain, comes with significant side effects that can impact both the patient and the caregiver. These side effects can include drowsiness, confusion, and constipation, among others. It's important to explore alternative methods, such as steroids or acetaminophen, before turning to oxycodone. These medications may have fewer side effects and be more suitable for managing your husband's pain.\\n\\nAdditionally, it's crucial to have open and honest conversations with your hospice nurse about your concerns and work collaboratively to find a solution that balances your husband's comfort and your ability to provide care. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to caregiving, and it's essential to approach each situation with compassion, empathy, and a willingness to adapt as needed.\\n\\nIt's essential to recognize that managing your husband's memory loss and pain is a complex issue, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed at times. It's crucial to prioritize self-care and seek support from friends, family, or support groups to help you navigate this challenging situation. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and there are resources available to help you provide the best possible care for your husband while maintaining your own emotional and physical well-being.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Your fear of rejection is a common issue, and it's essential to acknowledge and address the underlying emotions that contribute to this fear. It's important to remember that everyone experiences feelings of rejection at some point in their lives, and it's a natural part of the human experience. However, the way we respond to these feelings can have a significant impact on our mental and emotional well-being. To help you work through your fear of rejection, we could explore various therapeutic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, or psychodynamic therapy. These approaches can help you identify and challenge negative thought patterns, develop acceptance and mindfulness skills, and explore the unconscious motivations and emotions that contribute to your fear of rejection. Ultimately, the goal is to help you build the emotional resilience and self-confidence needed to form healthy, meaningful relationships and overcome your fear of rejection.</td>\n",

However, it's essential to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and success is not defined by a single metric. Instead, we can focus on our personal growth and the progress we've made towards our goals.\\n\\nIt might be helpful to explore the root causes of these feelings in therapy. We can work on developing coping mechanisms to manage the anxiety and learn to set healthy boundaries with your family. Additionally, we can challenge the negative self-talk and work on building a more compassionate and understanding relationship with yourself.\\n\\nIt's crucial to remember that therapy is a process, and it takes time and effort to see progress.

It's natural to feel overwhelmed by the intensity of these emotions, but it's essential to remember that this support system is an invaluable resource for your recovery.\\n\\nAs we've discussed, it's crucial to establish clear communication with your loved ones about your needs and boundaries. This will help you to maintain a healthy balance between receiving support and preserving your personal space. It's also important to remember that you have the right to ask for help when you need it and to lean on your support system during this time.\\n\\nThe connections you've rekindled with old friends and loved ones can provide a sense of familiarity and continuity, helping you to feel more grounded and less isolated. These relationships can play an essential role in your recovery and overall well-being, so it's important to cherish these moments and explore ways to maintain them even after you've returned to your normal routine.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore your feelings and concerns, I encourage you to reflect on the ways in which your support system has helped you to cope with your diagnosis and the challenges that come with it.

This experience has left you questioning your ability to self-motivate and believe in your own worth, even when others praise you. It's important to recognize that these feelings are common, yet deeply challenging. The weight of your past mistakes can be overwhelming, and it's natural to feel a sense of guilt and self-doubt as a result.\\n\\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and their consequences can vary greatly. While your past mistakes may haunt you, it's essential to focus on the present and the steps you can take to move forward. One way to do this is by practicing self-affirmation. This means acknowledging your strengths and capabilities, even when faced with feelings of doubt or guilt. It's not about denying the past, but rather acknowledging it and using it as a stepping stone towards growth.\\n\\nAs a counselor, I believe that it's essential to approach your situation with empathy and understanding.

These feelings are common, especially when considering new opportunities or pursuing personal goals. However, it's essential to recognize that everyone's journey is unique, and comparing yourself to others can be detrimental to your progress.\\n\\nInstead, focus on your strengths and the unique qualities that make your business idea stand out. Reflect on past accomplishments and the skills you've gained throughout your life. This can help build confidence and provide a solid foundation for moving forward.\\n\\nAdditionally, consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself, such as researching your market or creating a business plan. Breaking down larger goals into smaller tasks can make the process feel less daunting and help you build momentum.\\n\\nIt's also important to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that setbacks and failures are a natural part of the learning process. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and to experience fear or uncertainty. These emotions are not signs of weakness, but rather opportunities for growth.\\n\\nIn our next session, we can explore strategies for managing self-doubt and building self-confidence further. In the meantime, consider keeping a journal to document your thoughts and progress, and try engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you feel re-energized.  \n",

Consider seeking out support groups or resources for caregivers to help you navigate this process. Additionally, it may be helpful to explore the concept of \"acceptance\" in counseling psychology, which can help you find peace with the things you cannot change and focus on the things you can control. Remember, taking care of yourself is not a sign of weakness, but rather an essential part of being an effective caregiver.  \n",

It's essential to acknowledge the emotional toll this situation is taking on you as a caregiver. The fear of forgetting important tasks or mismanaging your husband's care can be overwhelming. At the same time, it's crucial to prioritize your husband's comfort and well-being. While it's natural to want to alleviate your own suffering, it's essential to remember that managing your husband's pain is an integral part of your role as a caregiver.\\n\\nIn terms of pain management, it's essential to consider the potential benefits and side effects of various medications. Oxycodone, while effective in managing intense pain, comes with significant side effects that can impact both the patient and the caregiver. These side effects can include drowsiness, confusion, and constipation, among others. It's important to explore alternative methods, such as steroids or acetaminophen, before turning to oxycodone. These medications may have fewer side effects and be more suitable for managing your husband's pain.\\n\\nAdditionally, it's crucial to have open and honest conversations with your hospice nurse about your concerns and work collaboratively to find a solution that balances your husband's comfort and your ability to provide care. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to caregiving, and it's essential to approach each situation with compassion, empathy, and a willingness to adapt as needed.\\n\\nIt's essential to recognize that managing your husband's memory loss and pain is a complex issue, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed at times. It's crucial to prioritize self-care and seek support from friends, family, or support groups to help you navigate this challenging situation. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and there are resources available to help you provide the best possible care for your husband while maintaining your own emotional and physical well-being.  \n",

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &amp;#34;triangulation&amp;#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &amp;#34;triangulated&amp;#34; by your wife and mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in thes...</td>\n",

It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (&amp;#34;Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.&amp;#34;), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;Hi there. It's great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don't lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, &amp;#34;I'm too pushy&amp;#34;, can be rewritten as, &amp;#34;I'm assertive and I go after what I want.&amp;#34; It can be hard to do since we tend to get &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that's not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. You've already taken the first step, so keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous, but I haven't heard of any that cause mouth blisters, so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you've suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you don't have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting &amp;#34;Ohm&amp;#34; to meditate. It's about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don't give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you. Like medication, you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps and best of luck to you.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

       "0  <p>What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &#34;triangulation&#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &#34;triangulated&#34; by your wife and mother.</p><p>This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.</p><p>I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.</p><p>If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. </p><p>Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in thes...   \n",

Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.</p><p>For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.</p><p>You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (&#34;Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.&#34;), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.</p><p>I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.</p><p>Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!</p>   \n",

It's great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don't lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle, right? </p><p>What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, &#34;I'm too pushy&#34;, can be rewritten as, &#34;I'm assertive and I go after what I want.&#34; It can be hard to do since we tend to get &#34;stuck&#34; in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.</p><p>Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that's not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. You've already taken the first step, so keep moving forward.</p>   \n",

Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous, but I haven't heard of any that cause mouth blisters, so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you've suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.</p><p>But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you don't have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting &#34;Ohm&#34; to meditate. It's about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don't give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you. Like medication, you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation.</p><p>I hope this helps and best of luck to you.</p>   \n",

The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with &amp;nbsp;Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: Arial; white-space: pre-wrap;\"&gt;Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.7142857142857142;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"&gt;The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment.

Then, once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from, switch. It's also good to restate what you think you are hearing. Then you know what each other is truly following about this. Also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement, just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also consider noticing what makes you feel valued, special, loved, or appreciated.

I always say that a little bit of guilt is healthy because it teaches us who we want to be. Listen to that voice. You don't have to lie to your mom to get what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;\"&gt;Now, you don't say how old you are, so part of my answer is going to be a bit vague. There's a big difference between being thirteen and your mom telling you what to do and being nineteen and your mom telling you what to do. The thing is that moms and dads start out making all your decisions for you when you're small, and they're supposed to, very gradually, give that control over to you. Different parents do this at different speeds, but in general you have to earn that freedom and trust...it's not just gonna be handed over to you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;\"&gt;You might not like this part...your parent has the right to make the rules. My guess is there's a reason why mom is holding you back. Even if it doesn't make sense to you, breaking her rules isn't going to get you what you want...which is freedom, right? I guarantee you that mom wants you to eventually earn freedom...but she's not supposed to give it to you until you're ready because her first job is to keep you safe.&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.42857;\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;I like that your mom has limits for you. Too many parents are sort of looking the other way, busy with their own thing. Whether you know it or not, you need protection like all kids do (appropriate for your age, of course).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.42857;\"&gt;It sounds like what you want to say to your mom is \"I want to make my own decisions about who I spend time with\". That's a normal wish, and I encourage you to say that to her. Depending on your age and whether you've earned it, she might listen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;\"&gt;So, you're sending h...</td>\n",

There are some awesome videos there that might help you! &amp;nbsp;I hope this helps some! &amp;nbsp;Don't forget to try to connect with other trans folks (even online) - it can be a great relief to know you're not alone in how you're feeling!

Because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time, at least you would know there was that time that was set aside. That may also help you to rekindle some conversations between you.</p><p>As far as your little fights, consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are open-ended (cannot be answered with just yes or no) and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing. Then, once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from, switch. It's also good to restate what you think you are hearing. Then you know what each other is truly following about this. Also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement, just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming from.</p><p>Also consider noticing what makes you feel valued, special, loved, or appreciated. Think of the same for your girlfriend. This could be a great discussion to have as well.</p>  \n",

You have no idea what is going to happen in the next second, so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story. &nbsp;Remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up. &nbsp;The false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams. Next, do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator? If not, find out. Then, set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps. As you accomplish each step, see your progress. &nbsp;Notice that you are moving closer to your goal. &nbsp;Every day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career. &nbsp;In fact, write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror. &nbsp;When you start to feel discouraged, remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if you'll make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out. Anything worth pursuing is going to take a lot of persistence and hard work. Stay with it! You and your family are worth it!</p>  \n",

I always say that a little bit of guilt is healthy because it teaches us who we want to be. Listen to that voice. You don't have to lie to your mom to get what you want.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Now, you don't say how old you are, so part of my answer is going to be a bit vague. There's a big difference between being thirteen and your mom telling you what to do and being nineteen and your mom telling you what to do. The thing is that moms and dads start out making all your decisions for you when you're small, and they're supposed to, very gradually, give that control over to you. Different parents do this at different speeds, but in general you have to earn that freedom and trust...it's not just gonna be handed over to you.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;\">You might not like this part...your parent has the right to make the rules. My guess is there's a reason why mom is holding you back. Even if it doesn't make sense to you, breaking her rules isn't going to get you what you want...which is freedom, right? I guarantee you that mom wants you to eventually earn freedom...but she's not supposed to give it to you until you're ready because her first job is to keep you safe.<span style=\"line-height: 1.42857;\">&nbsp;I like that your mom has limits for you. Too many parents are sort of looking the other way, busy with their own thing. Whether you know it or not, you need protection like all kids do (appropriate for your age, of course).</span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.42857;\">It sounds like what you want to say to your mom is \"I want to make my own decisions about who I spend time with\".

I am so glad you're reaching out! &nbsp;Sounds like you have some solid support in some areas of your life but are still dealing with some difficult dysphoria. &nbsp;I think it can depend on what kind of dysphoria you have - sometimes it's physical, social or mental. &nbsp;Sometimes physical dysphoria means less time around mirrors or plans to make showering less stressful (music, audio books, distraction). &nbsp;Sometimes online support networks can be a great source of ideas in this way (for social and mental dysphoria as well). &nbsp;Some of my clients do things that help them feel better in their bodies that don't require anyone to know (hair removal, binders, packing, hormones,) and other things. &nbsp;I recommend stopping by a website called Conversations with a Gender Therapist. There are some awesome videos there that might help you! &nbsp;I hope this helps some! &nbsp;Don't forget to try to connect with other trans folks (even online) - it can be a great relief to know you're not alone in how you're feeling! Best of luck!!</p>  \n",

If I was your therapist I'd ask you questions about your worries and how this is causing a problem in your life. You're causing perhaps permanent changes (damage?) to your body, and it's likely you're trying to express something...pain maybe? A therapist can help you to explore what's going on for you and how to get your needs for self-expression met in a more healthy way. Good luck!</p>  \n",

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &amp;#34;triangulation&amp;#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &amp;#34;triangulated&amp;#34; by your wife and mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in thes...</td>\n",

       "top     <p>What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &#34;triangulation&#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &#34;triangulated&#34; by your wife and mother.</p><p>This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.</p><p>I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.</p><p>If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. </p><p>Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have.

       "      <td>What you are describing is something psychologists have termed \"triangulation\" which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been \"triangulated\" by your wife and mother. This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint. I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love. If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated.

       "top     What you are describing is something psychologists have termed \"triangulation\" which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been \"triangulated\" by your wife and mother. This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint. I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love. If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated.

If you are young enough to use their insurance, that could be complicated, but depending on the state, there may be ways to work around that as well. If transportation is a problem, call a local mental health agency and see if they can connect you with assistance. In the meantime, try searching for a phone helpline in the county where you live. They may be able to help you figure out where you can get help. Another idea is that if you are in school, your guidance counselor may be able to provide links to where you can go for help. He or she may also be able to give you more specific ideas to help with your panic attacks. I know you said your mom refuses to offer help, which included seeing a doctor, but I wonder if she trusts the doctors that is your primary care physician (also called a family doctor) who you see when you have a minor medical ailment that may need medication. That doctor may be able to help you as well. Some of the information here may be helpful to you because it explains some of what anxiety is and there are some quizzes there that may give you information to discuss with a doctor or therapist when you get connected with one. http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/mental-health-anxiety-disorders This may give you other information to speak with your mom about. Remember that I'm not asking you to actually diagnose yourself with one of these things, but just offering some basic information that may help you be able to talk about what is going on. If you are having a panic attack or having a moment of anxiety, try focusing on different things in the room around you. It may help to shift your focus briefly outside of what you are feeling and that may lessen the feeling a bit. Also remember that sometimes anxiety leads to more anxiety about having a panic attack in the future. Remember that they usually and after a few minutes. It would also be helpful for you to keep track of what leads up to your anxiety. Best wishes to you and keep trying until you get connected to someone.</td>\n",

I always say that a little bit of guilt is healthy because it teaches us who we want to be. Listen to that voice. You don't have to lie to your mom to get what you want. Now, you don't say how old you are, so part of my answer is going to be a bit vague. There's a big difference between being thirteen and your mom telling you what to do and being nineteen and your mom telling you what to do. The thing is that moms and dads start out making all your decisions for you when you're small, and they're supposed to, very gradually, give that control over to you. Different parents do this at different speeds, but in general you have to earn that freedom and trust...it's not just gonna be handed over to you. You might not like this part...your parent has the right to make the rules. My guess is there's a reason why mom is holding you back. Even if it doesn't make sense to you, breaking her rules isn't going to get you what you want...which is freedom, right? I guarantee you that mom wants you to eventually earn freedom...but she's not supposed to give it to you until you're ready because her first job is to keep you safe. I like that your mom has limits for you. Too many parents are sort of looking the other way, busy with their own thing. Whether you know it or not, you need protection like all kids do (appropriate for your age, of course). It sounds like what you want to say to your mom is \"I want to make my own decisions about who I spend time with\". That's a normal wish, and I encourage you to say that to her. Depending on your age and whether you've earned it, she might listen. So, you're sending her that message that you want to send, but you're doing it in a sneaky way, and that's not going to go well when she finds out. It's called \"passive aggressive\" when you say something with a sneaky behaviour rather than with words. It's not a very healthy way of sending a message, because people feel disrespected. My guess is that your best bet is to be honest with mom, stop the sneaking around and come up with a detailed plan of how you're going to earn your freedom...eventually. She might listen to that.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello, and thank you for your question. Clearly this is something that has you very concerned. Sometimes thoughts are just thoughts, and they are pretty harmless. Many people have thoughts of killing someone, but they would never actually do it. They really don't even want to do it, they are just having a thought. Other times, thoughts are a sign of something more serious, and we should receive help when they start to worry us. I would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts. It is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgement. Now, If you begin to start thinking about killing someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality- you should call for help immediately. By help, I mean 9-11, or a family member or friend. You would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others. Again, none of this is to judge, but rather to encourage you to get the help you're seeking. Either way, when we become concerned about some aspect of our behavior, seeking counseling is usually a good choice. Be well, Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC</td>\n",

I feel like I love him, but I don't think I know him. What if he is not who I think he is? I cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend. I don't know, am I too obsessive? Every time we talk though, it's like magic. He makes me feel amazing, but what if I'm mistaken?   \n",

I have had a pantyhose/stocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since I was young. I have no history of sexual abuse growing up. I am currently single.   \n",

No matter what, I always was happy. I got into a relationship with this guy. I love him so much. We’re both teenagers. The week after his birthday, my mom made me stop talking to him. It broke me. He came to my house and talked to her, and she let us date again but not see each other. He comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that I have to lie to her.   \n",

       "22    I’ve known my boyfriend for several years. We were friends for a long time. In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. \\n\\nSoon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he didn’t seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know. Although he says he did, I hardly ever see him. He never got a job, which was in the original plan.  \\n\\nAfter that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in. I thought he had too. But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman. In fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. When I confronted him about this, he wasn’t apologetic. He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone. He even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car. I don’t know what to do.   \n",

You can get answers to your questions by talking to him...getting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have. You're asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship. So what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him? Fear of rejection? Fear of something else? If you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships, I recommend a therapist to help you work through that. I wish you well. :)  \n",

If you are young enough to use their insurance, that could be complicated, but depending on the state, there may be ways to work around that as well. If transportation is a problem, call a local mental health agency and see if they can connect you with assistance. In the meantime, try searching for a phone helpline in the county where you live. They may be able to help you figure out where you can get help. Another idea is that if you are in school, your guidance counselor may be able to provide links to where you can go for help. He or she may also be able to give you more specific ideas to help with your panic attacks. I know you said your mom refuses to offer help, which included seeing a doctor, but I wonder if she trusts the doctors that is your primary care physician (also called a family doctor) who you see when you have a minor medical ailment that may need medication. That doctor may be able to help you as well. Some of the information here may be helpful to you because it explains some of what anxiety is and there are some quizzes there that may give you information to discuss with a doctor or therapist when you get connected with one. http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/mental-health-anxiety-disorders This may give you other information to speak with your mom about. Remember that I'm not asking you to actually diagnose yourself with one of these things, but just offering some basic information that may help you be able to talk about what is going on. If you are having a panic attack or having a moment of anxiety, try focusing on different things in the room around you. It may help to shift your focus briefly outside of what you are feeling and that may lessen the feeling a bit. Also remember that sometimes anxiety leads to more anxiety about having a panic attack in the future. Remember that they usually and after a few minutes. It would also be helpful for you to keep track of what leads up to your anxiety. Best wishes to you and keep trying until you get connected to someone.  \n",

Concentrate more on what you'd like from your marriage.  This will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of him. Think over whether you wish to divorce or not. Since he hasn't taken any action, then for the moment, you can assume he is not sure of what he wants. Once you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage, including feeling uncertain if you'd like it to end or continue, then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotions. Try to re-direct your speculations about, \"what does he want\", \"I wonder what he's thinking\", back to answering these very reasonable questions, about yourself. This will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with him. Good luck!  \n",

       "229   Hi Los Angeles, I can tell you have a moral backbone because it's hurting you to lie to your mom. I always say that a little bit of guilt is healthy because it teaches us who we want to be. Listen to that voice. You don't have to lie to your mom to get what you want. Now, you don't say how old you are, so part of my answer is going to be a bit vague. There's a big difference between being thirteen and your mom telling you what to do and being nineteen and your mom telling you what to do. The thing is that moms and dads start out making all your decisions for you when you're small, and they're supposed to, very gradually, give that control over to you. Different parents do this at different speeds, but in general you have to earn that freedom and trust...it's not just gonna be handed over to you. You might not like this part...your parent has the right to make the rules. My guess is there's a reason why mom is holding you back. Even if it doesn't make sense to you, breaking her rules isn't going to get you what you want...which is freedom, right? I guarantee you that mom wants you to eventually earn freedom...but she's not supposed to give it to you until you're ready because her first job is to keep you safe. I like that your mom has limits for you. Too many parents are sort of looking the other way, busy with their own thing. Whether you know it or not, you need protection like all kids do (appropriate for your age, of course). It sounds like what you want to say to your mom is \"I want to make my own decisions about who I spend time with\". That's a normal wish, and I encourage you to say that to her. Depending on your age and whether you've earned it, she might listen. So, you're sending her that message that you want to send, but you're doing it in a sneaky way, and that's not going to go well when she finds out. It's called \"passive aggressive\" when you say something with a sneaky behaviour rather than with words. It's not a very healthy way of sending a message, because people feel disrespected. My guess is that your best bet is to be honest with mom, stop the sneaking around and come up with a detailed plan of how you're going to earn your freedom...eventually. She might listen to that.  \n",

Clearly this is something that has you very concerned. Sometimes thoughts are just thoughts, and they are pretty harmless. Many people have thoughts of killing someone, but they would never actually do it. They really don't even want to do it, they are just having a thought. Other times, thoughts are a sign of something more serious, and we should receive help when they start to worry us. I would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts. It is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgement. Now, If you begin to start thinking about killing someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality- you should call for help immediately. By help, I mean 9-11, or a family member or friend. You would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others. Again, none of this is to judge, but rather to encourage you to get the help you're seeking. Either way, when we become concerned about some aspect of our behavior, seeking counseling is usually a good choice. Be well, Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC  \n",

In my experience, relationships such as these rarely become positive ones. Violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning (you looking through his phone), it is indefensible. You have to look at these red flags and ask yourself, “Is this really someone I want to marry? Is he an asset to my life?” I think you’ll realize he is not. Best of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness, dignity and respect.  \n",

Please rest assured that you are not a sociopath, and that your reactions are normal responses to traumatic events. I'm guessing you are experiencing a sense of numbness, which is a common response to trauma. The best thing you can do is to get some trauma counseling with a professional counselor.  As you process your experience, you will be able to feel emotions again. However, the first feelings to come back may be related to trauma, such as fear, panic, and a sense of hyper vigilance. A professional counselor will be able to help you tolerate these feelings, manage them, and heal from your trauma.  "

It's important to remember that I am not a medical professional, and if you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, seeking help from a qualified healthcare professional is essential.\\n\\nPanic Attack Symptoms:\\nA panic attack is a sudden and intense surge of fear or discomfort that reaches its peak within minutes. Some common symptoms of a panic attack include:\\n\\n1. Heart palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.\\n2. Sweating or trembling.\\n3. Shortness of breath or feeling smothered.\\n4. Feeling of choking or a lump in the throat.\\n5. Chest pain or discomfort.\\n6. Nausea or abdominal distress.\\n7. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint.\\n8. Chills or hot flashes.\\n9. Numbness or tingling sensations.\\n10. Fear of losing control or going crazy.\\n11. Fear of dying.\\n12. A sense of detachment from reality or oneself (depersonalization).\\n13. A feeling of being detached from the surroundings (derealization).\\n\\nIt's important to note that panic attacks are often unpredictable and can occur even in situations where there is no immediate danger.\\n\\nAnxiety Attack Symptoms:\\nAnxiety attacks are different from panic attacks in terms of intensity and duration. While panic attacks are sudden and reach their peak rapidly, anxiety attacks are typically associated with prolonged feelings of worry, nervousness, and fear. Symptoms of an anxiety attack may include:\\n\\n1. Excessive worrying or fear about future events or situations.\\n2. Restlessness or feeling on edge.\\n3. Muscle tension or aches.\\n4. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.\\n5. Irritability.\\n6. Fatigue or feeling easily fatigued.\\n7. Sleep disturbances, such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\\n8. Avoidance of triggers or situations that provoke anxiety.\\n\\nAnxiety attacks can be triggered by specific stressors or occur without an apparent cause. They might build up gradually and persist for an extended period.\\n\\nRemember, it's crucial to consult a qualified mental health professional to obtain an accurate diagnosis and receive personalized guidance and support. They can help develop a suitable treatment plan to manage panic attacks, anxiety attacks, or any other mental health concerns you may be facing.</td>\n",

The more common types include:\\n\\n1. Anxiety disorders: People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. \\n\\n2. Mood disorders: These disorders, also called affective disorders, involve persistent feelings of sadness or periods of feeling overly happy, or fluctuations from extreme happiness to extreme sadness.\\n\\n3. Psychotic disorders: Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of psychotic disorders are hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder.\\n\\n4. Eating disorders: Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food.\\n\\n5. Personality disorders: People with personality disorders have extreme and inflexible personality traits that are distressing to the person and/or cause problems in work, school, or social relationships.\\n\\n6. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): People with OCD are plagued by constant thoughts or fears that cause them to perform certain rituals or routines. An example is a person with an unreasonable fear of germs who constantly washes their hands.\\n\\n7. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): PTSD is a condition that can develop following a traumatic and/or terrifying event, such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a natural disaster.</td>\n",

They’re accompanied by very challenging physical symptoms, like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea. Unexpected panic attacks occur without an obvious cause. Expected panic attacks are cued by external stressors, like phobias. Panic attacks can happen to anyone, but having more than one may be a sign of panic disorder, a mental health condition characterized by sudden and repeated panic attacks.\n",

The more common types include:\\n\\n1. Anxiety disorders: People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. \\n\\n2. Mood disorders: These disorders, also called affective disorders, involve persistent feelings of sadness or periods of feeling overly happy, or fluctuations from extreme happiness to extreme sadness.\\n\\n3. Psychotic disorders: Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of psychotic disorders are hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder.\\n\\n4. Eating disorders: Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food.\\n\\n5. Personality disorders: People with personality disorders have extreme and inflexible personality traits that are distressing to the person and/or cause problems in work, school, or social relationships.\\n\\n6. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): People with OCD are plagued by constant thoughts or fears that cause them to perform certain rituals or routines.

They’re accompanied by very challenging physical symptoms, like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea. Unexpected panic attacks occur without an obvious cause. Expected panic attacks are cued by external stressors, like phobias.

It's important to remember that I am not a medical professional, and if you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, seeking help from a qualified healthcare professional is essential.\\n\\nPanic Attack Symptoms:\\nA panic attack is a sudden and intense surge of fear or discomfort that reaches its peak within minutes. Some common symptoms of a panic attack include:\\n\\n1. Heart palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.\\n2. Sweating or trembling.\\n3. Shortness of breath or feeling smothered.\\n4. Feeling of choking or a lump in the throat.\\n5. Chest pain or discomfort.\\n6. Nausea or abdominal distress.\\n7. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint.\\n8. Chills or hot flashes.\\n9. Numbness or tingling sensations.\\n10. Fear of losing control or going crazy.\\n11. Fear of dying.\\n12. A sense of detachment from reality or oneself (depersonalization).\\n13. A feeling of being detached from the surroundings (derealization).\\n\\nIt's important to note that panic attacks are often unpredictable and can occur even in situations where there is no immediate danger.\\n\\nAnxiety Attack Symptoms:\\nAnxiety attacks are different from panic attacks in terms of intensity and duration. While panic attacks are sudden and reach their peak rapidly, anxiety attacks are typically associated with prolonged feelings of worry, nervousness, and fear. Symptoms of an anxiety attack may include:\\n\\n1. Excessive worrying or fear about future events or situations.\\n2. Restlessness or feeling on edge.\\n3. Muscle tension or aches.\\n4. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.\\n5. Irritability.\\n6. Fatigue or feeling easily fatigued.\\n7. Sleep disturbances, such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\\n8. Avoidance of triggers or situations that provoke anxiety.\\n\\nAnxiety attacks can be triggered by specific stressors or occur without an apparent cause. They might build up gradually and persist for an extended period.\\n\\nRemember, it's crucial to consult a qualified mental health professional to obtain an accurate diagnosis and receive personalized guidance and support. They can help develop a suitable treatment plan to manage panic attacks, anxiety attacks, or any other mental health concerns you may be facing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>There are many different conditions that are recognized as mental illnesses. The more common types include:\\n\\n1. Anxiety disorders: People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. \\n\\n2. Mood disorders: These disorders, also called affective disorders, involve persistent feelings of sadness or periods of feeling overly happy, or fluctuations from extreme happiness to extreme sadness.\\n\\n3. Psychotic disorders: Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of psychotic disorders are hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder.\\n\\n4. Eating disorders: Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food.\\n\\n5. Personality disorders: People with personality disorders have extreme and inflexible personality traits that are distressing to the person and/or cause problems in work, school, or social relationships.\\n\\n6. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): People with OCD are plagued by constant thoughts or fears that cause them to perform certain rituals or routines. An example is a person with an unreasonable fear of germs who constantly washes their hands.\\n\\n7. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): PTSD is a condition that can develop following a traumatic and/or terrifying event, such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a natural disaster.</td>\n",

They’re accompanied by very challenging physical symptoms, like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea. Unexpected panic attacks occur without an obvious cause. Expected panic attacks are cued by external stressors, like phobias. Panic attacks can happen to anyone, but having more than one may be a sign of panic disorder, a mental health condition characterized by sudden and repeated panic attacks.  \n",
       "1  Panic attacks and anxiety attacks can share some similarities, but they also have distinct features. It's important to remember that I am not a medical professional, and if you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, seeking help from a qualified healthcare professional is essential.\\n\\nPanic Attack Symptoms:\\nA panic attack is a sudden and intense surge of fear or discomfort that reaches its peak within minutes. Some common symptoms of a panic attack include:\\n\\n1. Heart palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.\\n2. Sweating or trembling.\\n3. Shortness of breath or feeling smothered.\\n4. Feeling of choking or a lump in the throat.\\n5. Chest pain or discomfort.\\n6. Nausea or abdominal distress.\\n7. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint.\\n8. Chills or hot flashes.\\n9. Numbness or tingling sensations.\\n10. Fear of losing control or going crazy.\\n11. Fear of dying.\\n12. A sense of detachment from reality or oneself (depersonalization).\\n13. A feeling of being detached from the surroundings (derealization).\\n\\nIt's important to note that panic attacks are often unpredictable and can occur even in situations where there is no immediate danger.\\n\\nAnxiety Attack Symptoms:\\nAnxiety attacks are different from panic attacks in terms of intensity and duration. While panic attacks are sudden and reach their peak rapidly, anxiety attacks are typically associated with prolonged feelings of worry, nervousness, and fear. Symptoms of an anxiety attack may include:\\n\\n1. Excessive worrying or fear about future events or situations.\\n2. Restlessness or feeling on edge.\\n3. Muscle tension or aches.\\n4. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.\\n5. Irritability.\\n6. Fatigue or feeling easily fatigued.\\n7. Sleep disturbances, such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\\n8. Avoidance of triggers or situations that provoke anxiety.\\n\\nAnxiety attacks can be triggered by specific stressors or occur without an apparent cause. They might build up gradually and persist for an extended period.\\n\\nRemember, it's crucial to consult a qualified mental health professional to obtain an accurate diagnosis and receive personalized guidance and support. They can help develop a suitable treatment plan to manage panic attacks, anxiety attacks, or any other mental health concerns you may be facing.  \n",

The more common types include:\\n\\n1. Anxiety disorders: People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. \\n\\n2. Mood disorders: These disorders, also called affective disorders, involve persistent feelings of sadness or periods of feeling overly happy, or fluctuations from extreme happiness to extreme sadness.\\n\\n3. Psychotic disorders: Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of psychotic disorders are hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder.\\n\\n4. Eating disorders: Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food.\\n\\n5. Personality disorders: People with personality disorders have extreme and inflexible personality traits that are distressing to the person and/or cause problems in work, school, or social relationships.\\n\\n6. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): People with OCD are plagued by constant thoughts or fears that cause them to perform certain rituals or routines. An example is a person with an unreasonable fear of germs who constantly washes their hands.\\n\\n7. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): PTSD is a condition that can develop following a traumatic and/or terrifying event, such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a natural disaster.  \n",
