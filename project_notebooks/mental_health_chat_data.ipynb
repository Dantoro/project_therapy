         "If everyone thinks you're worthless, then maybe you need to find new people to hang out with.Seriously, the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in self-esteem.Otherwise, you can go round and round trying to understand why you're not worthless, then go back to the same crowd and be knocked down again.There are many inspirational messages you can find in social media.  Maybe read some of the ones which state that no person is worthless, and that everyone has a good purpose to their life.Also, since our culture is so saturated with the belief that if someone doesn't feel good about themselves that this is somehow terrible.Bad feelings are part of living.  They are the motivation to remove ourselves from situations and relationships which do us more harm than good.Bad feelings do feel terrible.   Your feeling of worthlessness may be good in the sense of motivating you to find out that you are much better than your feelings today."

         "Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to \"snap out of it\" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC"

         "Therapy is essential for those that are feeling depressed and worthless. When I work with those that are experiencing concerns related to feeling of depression and issues with self esteem. I generally work with my client to help build coping skills to reduce level of depression and to assist with strengthening  self esteem, by guiding my client with CBT practices. CBT helps with gaining a better awareness of how your thought process influences your belief system, and how your beliefs impact your actions and the outcome of your behaviors.  This process isn’t easy but it helps teach an individual that we don’t always have control over what happens in our lives but we can control how we interpret, feel, and behave. CBT is good for individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, toxic relationships, stress, self esteem, codependency, etc."

He's lucky to have you on his side (although he may not always see it that way).As far as whether you can sign him in, that depends on a lot of different things.I would suggest that you Google the state and county that you live in as well as some phrase similar to \"crisis hotline.\" They can tell you how it works in that county. My guess is that you could sign him in as long as he met the criteria for admission at that moment, but I can't  be entirely sure. You could also ask the person on the phone about financial responsibility. I have not heard of that being a problem, but I guess it would depend on insurance.If you have trouble finding a local  hotline, consider calling the national crisis number (800-273-8255) and ask them to help you find someone local."

When I found out I was pregnant, we had just broken up. Five months later, I lost the baby, and we did not speak for a few weeks. Now we are talking, and he says he loves me but is afraid I will hurt him \"again.\" I just want to know where to go with this because I love him so much, and I want to get back to us being happy and a family.",
         "I'm truly sorry to hear that your relationship is causing you such distress at this time. When we are in relationships, trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship.  Often, when we feel we are required to prove ourselves, feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive.  In situations like this, I often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner.  Your fears about his response are valid, as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them.  You can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses.  In the end, these are issues that you cannot conquer for him - you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust.  You may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to, as well.  But in terms of your question, only you can decide whether you feel you can remain in a relationship in which you defend yourself against an uncommitted offense."

         "I'm glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse.One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe and supportive, is that the one who is being abused, starts to question their own judgement, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking.This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful.  Regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless, a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions.Stick with what your own intuition tells you.There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on.Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree.  People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly \"be alone\", even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.These are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart.Listen to yourself about leaving this guy. Your inner self does not lie to you."

         "I'm always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me.    How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?",
         "Thanks for reaching out. This is a great question. Communication is definitely a 2-way street. One person cannot participate in a discussion. It takes a talker and a listener. Furthermore, communication will breakdown if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying.  since I can't ask you questions about what is going on, I am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when I work with couples. One person focuses more on solving the issue, than listening to their partner.  This can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be \"heard.\"I understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you. That can be really frustrating and difficult and I want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationship.One of the best strategies to gettting heard, is actually to BE A GOOD LISTENER to someone else. I know you are probably already a good listener and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive, right? You want to get heard and now you are the one doing the listening. But this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills. In other words, you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later on. Here are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teach:Pay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation. No texting or distractions. Lean in. Focus.Listen for content and for emotion. Clarify what you don't understand. Try to understand the person's underlying emotions. Don't rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person. Sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going on. Encourage the other person to continue speaking, Nod and vocalize that you hear what they are saying.Ask questions to get to understand the other person's point of view.I believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills, and the other person feels heard, they will be more likely to listen to us. If you don't find that this doesn't spill over in that way, then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better. Then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it. If there is push back from him, set up a trial period to just try the skill, perhaps for 2 weeks and see if it helps. If communication is really breaking down, then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skills.Best of luck to you!"

I have been having panic attacks, feeling like I can't control my fears, and I can't even bring myself to care if I live or die anymore. The problem is that I don't know who to ask for help. When I try to talk to my parents, I freeze completely and can't do anything but make a joke because never once in my life have we talked about our feelings.",
         "I understand that talking about our feelings can be awkward and using jokes is a way to relieve that awkwardness, but there is a right or wrong way to talk about your feelings. The important part is to recognize that you need help addressing those feelings and reaching out, which you are doing already.  Having small conversations with your family is helpful, you can explain to them that you have been experiencing emotional discomfort and would like to talk to them about it.   Since you been experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and have thought about dying,  It is VERY important that you ask them to help you make an appointment with a mental health professional.  Those symptoms indicate that your body is having a hard time managing intense feelings and it will be helpful if you understand why they occur and how to cope with them. You may contact your school counselor or you may schedule an appointment with a local therapist.  You may contact the Texas Crisis Hotline 800-989-6884 where you can talk or chat with mental health professionals or schedule a teletherapy session.   The National Crisis Hotline is also available for calling and texting 1-800-273-8255.I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Texas, currently providing services in West Houston.  You may reach me at 787-466-5478 to schedule an appointment.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------¿Cómo hablo de mis sentimientos de depresión y con quién hablo?Soy un adolecente.  He estado experimentando episodios de depresión severa (si es lo que creo) por muchos años.  Siempre se pone peor.  He estado teniendo ataques de pánico, sintiendo que no puedo controlar mis miedos y sintiendo que ya no importa si quiero vivir o morir.  El problema es que ya no sé a quién pedirle ayuda.  Cuando intento hablar con mis padres, Me congelo y solo puedo hacer bromas porque nunca en mi vida hemos hablado de nuestros sentimientos. Entiendo que hablar de tus emociones puede hacernos sentir inadecuados, y bromear es una manera de manejar ese sentimiento incómodo, pero no hay forma correcta o incorrecta de hablar sobre tus sentimientos.  Lo importante es reconocer que necesitas ayuda para manejarlos, y ya tu estas en ese proceso.  Tener pequeñas conversaciones con tu familia te ayudara a explicarles los sentimientos que estas experimentando.  Es importante que les pidas hacer una cita con un profesional de la salud mental, ya que has estado experimentando síntomas que indican que tu cuerpo ya no puede manejar tus sentimientos y necesita nuevas herramientas.  Puedes contactar a tu consejero escolar, o a un proveedor de salud mental cerca de ti o por teléfono.  Mientras tanto, puedes llamar a la línea de crisis de Texas 800-989-6884 para hablar con un profesional de salud mental.  La línea nacional de crisis también esta disponible en todos los Estados Unidos y proveen servicios en español 1-800-273-8255\r\nYo soy una Consejera Profesional Licenciada en Texas y Puerto Rico, veo clientes en el este de Houston y proveo servicios de tele terapia.  Para una cita puedes llamar al 787-466-5478."

         "Hello, and thank you for your question. Bipolar disorder is generally characterized by extreme changes in mood, ranging from mania (highs) to depression (lows). There are different types; however, so here is a website that gives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder: http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression?page=2After reviewing these symptoms, if you believe you may have bipolar disorder, then you may want to see your primary care provider or a counselor. Bipolar disorder is treatable, but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management. For example, some people may not get regular sleep, but proper rest is important for bipolar management. A counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make. The good news is that many people live happy, healthy, and productive lives with bipolar disorder. So, if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder, it doesn't mean that things can't get better. There is currently no \"cure\" for bipolar disorder, but with proper medication and lifestyle management, people can do quite well.Hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC "

         "Well, as hurtful as witnessing your boyfriend's closeness with his female friend, I\"m glad you saw firsthand the dynamic of your concern.There isn't anything you can directly do to stop his relationship with this lady.It is possible to influence his side of their relationship.Directly telling him your discomfort with how close the two are, may make him pause before engaging with her in a discussion.  This is nothing to count on since the control is in his hands and not yours.I'm sorry to read that the option to leave this relationship is out of the question.The only way left is to get used to the fact that you don't like this aspect of your boyfriend, and this is a disheartening outlook overall to you and to your relationship overall.If after repeated effort to influence him by your opinions, your effort to adjust to a situation you don't like, if at all possible, consider a longterm plan to discontinue this relationship because by that time it may feel very oppressive in your life."

Now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices I made for them the past 15 years as a single mom.

This is one of the hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move forward. In the mean time, immerse yourself with positivity (i.e. Good friends, hobbies, exercise) and try to schedule a time with a counselor. Perhaps there will be a support group you could also join.

         "One thing you could try is to talk to your partner when she's not angry about the following:If she's angry, maybe she can talk with you about what she is angry about rather than calling you names.If she gets angry and then calms down a little while later, maybe one of you can take a timeout in the discussion and set a time when you will come back to it.Discuss what it is that you find acceptable for you to do during an argumentDiscuss what it is that you find unacceptable for you to do during an argumentDiscuss what is acceptable for her to do during an argumentDiscuss what is on acceptable for her to do during an argumentYour partner can answer the same questions related to herself and you.I can't emphasize enough how important it is to have this discussion when there is not an argument going on. Perhaps you could mention that you would like to talk about something that is really important and see if the current time is a good time. If not, consider when in the next 24 to 48 hours would be a good time.It may also be helpful to discuss these ideas with a local therapist. The therapist may also be able to help both of you figure out where the anger is coming from and where she has learned to react this way.If it is abuse, it may be even more difficult to have these important discussions. It may be helpful for you to see a local therapist by yourself to assess things like physical and emotional safety."

I've tried visualization, positive thinking, and even medication, but nothing seems to work. I've been feeling lost and helpless, and I don't know what to do next. My mind is a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, and I can't seem to make sense of it all. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of confusion, and I can't seem to find my way out.",
         "I understand that you've been dealing with a sense of confusion and chaos in your thoughts and emotions for some time now. It's been a challenging journey, and it's commendable that you've tried various approaches like visualization, positive thinking, and medication to manage your symptoms. However, it's clear that these methods haven't been effective for you. It's essential to acknowledge that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and what works for one person might not work for another. Today, we're going to approach this differently. We're going to identify a specific concern related to your mental health that you'd like to work on, and we'll break it down into manageable steps. We'll define the problem as a feeling of being overwhelmed by your thoughts and emotions, and we'll set realistic goals for managing this feeling. We'll explore the root causes of this confusion, such as past traumas, current stressors, and any underlying psychological conditions. We'll also examine your thought patterns and emotional responses to these triggers, and we'll develop strategies to challenge and reframe negative thoughts. This process is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and it's designed to help you face your challenges more effectively by changing the way you think and feel about them. Let's begin by discussing the specific incidents or concerns that have been contributing to your feelings of confusion and chaos. We can explore these further and come up with strategies to help you manage them."

Balancing caregiving responsibilities with personal relationships can be a delicate dance, and it's common to encounter resistance when setting boundaries. I want to help you explore strategies for communicating your needs more effectively and setting clearer boundaries. Additionally, I see that your anxiety levels are significantly impacting your ability to focus on self-care. We can work together to identify the root causes of your anxiety and develop a plan to manage it more effectively.

         "I can see that you're dealing with a great deal of anxiety and that it's impacting your ability to focus and be productive. It's important to remember that anxiety is a normal response to stress, but when it becomes chronic and interferes with your daily life, it can be debilitating.\r\n\r\nOne approach to managing anxiety is through cognitive-behavioral techniques. This involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, or cognitive distortions, that contribute to your anxiety. For example, you might be thinking things like \"I can't do this,\" or \"I'll never be able to handle this situation.\" These thoughts can create a cycle of anxiety and make it even harder to focus and be productive.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is through relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation. These techniques can help you manage your physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a racing heart or tense muscles, and can help you feel more calm and focused.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax. This might include things like reading, taking a walk, or practicing a hobby. By taking care of yourself, you'll be better equipped to manage your anxiety and be more effective in your role as a helper to others.\r\n\r\nLastly, it's crucial to set realistic and attainable goals for yourself. This means identifying what you can realistically accomplish, given the resources and constraints you have. And remember, it's essential to distinguish between facts and assumptions when setting these goals. For example, instead of assuming that you can't do anything about the situation, focus on what you can do and set goals based on that.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to acknowledge and address any obstacles that might be preventing you from achieving these goals. By identifying and addressing these obstacles, you'll be better equipped to make progress and feel more in control of the situation."

I'm also worried about the financial burden of his care and the potential impact on my own finances. I've been trying to process these feelings, but I can't seem to shake them.",
         "It's understandable that you're feeling a range of emotions, including guilt and worry, in the aftermath of your uncle's passing. Grief is a complex and multifaceted experience, and it's common to feel a sense of responsibility or regret when a loved one passes away. Your concern about the financial burden of your uncle's care is also a valid one, as caregiving can be a significant financial strain. It's important to acknowledge and validate these feelings, while also exploring ways to manage them effectively.\r\n\r\nOne approach we could consider is mindfulness meditation, which can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions without judgment. This can help you develop a greater sense of self-compassion and acceptance, which can be beneficial in managing feelings of guilt and regret. Additionally, we could explore strategies for managing the financial burden of your uncle's care, such as researching available resources, creating a budget, and seeking out financial assistance programs.\r\n\r\nAnother approach we could consider is cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can help you challenge and reframe negative thoughts and beliefs that contribute to feelings of guilt and worry. For example, you might be able to reframe your thoughts about your role in your uncle's care to focus on the things you were able to do for him, rather than the things you couldn't. We could also explore ways to challenge the belief that you're solely responsible for your uncle's financial care, and explore alternative sources of support and resources.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the goal of our sessions would be to help you develop a more comprehensive understanding of your emotions and experiences, and to explore strategies for managing them effectively. This would involve a collaborative and empathetic approach, grounded in professional ethical standards and informed by key concepts in counseling psychology, such as mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and self-compassion. I'm here to support you in any way I can, and I believe that with a thoughtful and compassionate approach, we can help you navigate this challenging time."

Another approach is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which can help you develop skills to manage stress and anxiety through mindfulness practices. It's essential to work with a mental health professional to determine which approach is best for you and to develop a personalized treatment plan.\r\n\r\nRemember, healing is a process, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself. It's okay to ask for help, and it's essential to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being.

Instead, let's explore ways to reconnect with your daughter and repair any perceived damage.\r\n\r\nFirst, we can practice self-compassion and acknowledge that everyone experiences grief differently. It's essential to recognize that your focus on your own feelings doesn't diminish the importance of your role as a parent. Second, we can work on open and honest communication with your daughter, expressing your feelings and concerns while also listening to hers. This can help you both better understand each other's perspectives and begin the healing process.\r\n\r\nLastly, consider engaging in activities that strengthen your bond with your daughter. This can be as simple as sharing a meal, watching a movie, or even just having a heart-to-heart conversation. By focusing on the positive aspects of your relationship and taking steps to repair any perceived damage, you can begin to move past these feelings of guilt and neglect.\r\n\r\nIn this therapeutic approach, the counselor acknowledges the patient's feelings while also offering practical steps to address the underlying issues. The counselor's response is grounded in the principles of counseling psychology, including self-compassion, open communication, and the importance of repairing relationships. By offering a compassionate yet strategic response, the counselor helps the patient begin the process of healing and moving forward."

Last time she stayed with me, it was a much nicer experience as there were fewer stressors. But this time, with the death of my grandpa and other changes, she's been more stressed and it's affecting me negatively. I'm finding it hard to enjoy her company and I just want some space.",
         "Your words paint a vivid picture of the complex emotional landscape you're navigating right now. The stress that your mother is experiencing is palpable, and it's understandable that her distress is spilling over into your living space and affecting your relationship with her. It's important to recognize that the circumstances surrounding her stress are beyond her control, but it's also crucial to acknowledge the impact it's having on you. The memory of a more peaceful time when she stayed with you serves as a poignant contrast to the present situation. It's natural to crave that sense of tranquility and to feel frustrated when it's elusive.\r\n\r\nIn response to your concerns, I'd like to propose a few potential strategies for managing the current situation. First, let's explore the possibility of creating routines and structures that can help reduce stressors for both you and your mother. This might involve setting aside specific times for quiet activities, establishing clear boundaries around communication and personal space, and prioritizing self-care practices like exercise, meditation, or hobbies.\r\n\r\nAnother approach could be to focus on effective communication. It's essential to express your feelings to your mother in a compassionate and understanding way, while also being open to her perspective and needs.

         "Your concern for your mother's wellbeing is a natural response to her current situation. It's understandable that you'd want to ensure she's receiving the best possible care given the high-risk environment of the hospital. However, it's essential to remember that healthcare professionals, including nurses, often face immense stress and emotional burden in their work. Their reactions, such as laughter, might not always be a reflection of their feelings towards your concerns but rather a coping mechanism to manage their emotions. I encourage you to continue advocating for your mother's care while keeping an open mind about the nurse's intentions. It might also be helpful to gather more information about the hospital's policies and resources regarding patient care and infection control. This will not only help you feel more informed and empowered but also provide you with valuable knowledge to share with the nurse. Remember, clear and respectful communication is key to ensuring your mother receives the best possible care."

         "I've been struggling with strong emotions and impulsive actions, especially when it comes to food. I've heard that I should stop and think before I act, but it's hard for me to determine the underlying issues of my emotions. Sometimes, I feel like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster, and I don't know what's causing these intense feelings. I've tried to keep a journal to track my emotions and triggers, but it feels like I'm just documenting the chaos rather than making sense of it.",
         "Your struggle is understandable, and it's important to remember that emotions are a natural part of being human. The ADAPT model, which stands for Acknowledge, Define, Adjust, and Practice, can be a helpful framework for managing emotions and impulsive actions. Let's start by acknowledging your emotions and impulses. This means accepting that they are a part of you and recognizing that they are valid. It's essential to understand that emotions are not good or bad, they just are. Now, let's move on to defining the problem. This involves identifying the specific emotions and triggers that are causing your impulsive actions. We can use a problem checklist to help us with this. This checklist includes identifying the problem, understanding the problem, determining the cause of the problem, and setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your emotional rollercoaster is often triggered by feelings of sadness or loneliness, we can explore the underlying causes of these emotions. Perhaps there's a specific relationship or situation that's causing you to feel this way. Or maybe there's a deeper emotional wound that's being reopened. By gaining a clearer understanding of the underlying causes of your emotions, we can begin to address them in a healthy and productive way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's important to recognize that emotions are complex and multifaceted. They can be influenced by a variety of factors, including biological, psychological, and environmental factors. For instance, hormonal imbalances, trauma, or stress can all contribute to intense emotions and impulsive actions. By taking a holistic approach to understanding your emotions, we can develop a more comprehensive and effective approach to managing them.\r\n\r\nOnce we've identified the underlying causes of your emotions and triggers, we can begin to adjust your thoughts and behaviors to better manage them. This might involve learning new coping skills, such as mindfulness meditation or cognitive restructuring. It could also involve making lifestyle changes, such as getting regular exercise or improving your diet. By taking a proactive and compassionate approach to managing your emotions, you can begin to break free from the cycle of impulsive actions and develop a greater sense of emotional resilience.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to practice this exercise regularly, as it can help you develop a deeper understanding of your emotions and triggers, and ultimately, lead to healthier and more productive ways of coping with them. Today, we've discussed the first two steps of the ADAPT model, which are acknowledging your emotions and defining the problem. Next time, we'll explore how to adjust your thoughts and behaviors to better manage your emotions and impulses.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n"

The fear of exclusion and the potential for conflict can be overwhelming, especially when dealing with a family dynamic that's historically challenging.

Instead, it can be an opportunity to practice effective communication, problem-solving, and conflict resolution skills. One approach could be to establish clear guidelines for decision-making, such as setting deadlines for responses, establishing a budget, and establishing a process for addressing disagreements. Additionally, considering involving a neutral third party, like a family mediator or a trusted friend, might help facilitate productive discussions and minimize the potential for conflict.

I've been going through her things, and I've found a collection of items she had, including healing stones, angel figurines, and jewelry. I want to take some of these items to the memorial service, but I'm worried about what others might say or think. I feel like I'm betraying her memory by not following the traditional funeral practices.",
         "I can imagine how difficult it is for you to navigate this complex emotional terrain. Your wife's passing has left you feeling lost and alone, and now you're faced with the challenge of planning a memorial service that honors her memory while also addressing your own emotional needs. The items you've discovered are meaningful to you, and it's natural to want to incorporate them into the memorial service.\r\n\r\nThe traditional funeral practices may not resonate with you, and that's okay. It's essential to remember that a memorial service is a personal event, and it should reflect the unique nature of your relationship with your wife. You're not betraying her memory by making choices that honor her in a way that feels authentic to you.\r\n\r\nOne approach we could take is focusing on the practical steps to ensure that the people who matter to you have a say or are satisfied with the decisions made. You could involve her friends and family in the planning process, discussing your ideas and concerns with them. Their support and understanding can help alleviate any fears or doubts you might have.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be working to build your confidence in the decisions you make. It's important to recognize that your feelings and needs are valid, and that you have the right to make choices that honor your wife's memory in a way that feels authentic to you. This process may involve exploring your emotions surrounding loss, grief, and the unique bond you shared with your wife.\r\n\r\nIn counseling, we can work together to develop strategies for managing your emotions and building your confidence in your decisions. We can also explore ways to communicate effectively with your loved ones about your plans for the memorial service. Through this process, you'll gain a deeper understanding of your grief and the unique ways in which you can honor your wife's memory.\r\n\r\nAs a counselor, I acknowledge your desire to be a benevolent dictator, but I also recognize the fear and anxiety that comes with the potential for negative backlash. To help you navigate this complex emotional landscape, I'd like to explore the origins of your fear. When have you encountered negative feedback in the past, and how did it make you feel? Understanding the specifics of these situations will provide valuable insights into your current predicament.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it's essential to recognize that the fear of negative feedback is a common human experience. Many people struggle with this issue, and it's a natural response to the inherent uncertainty and vulnerability that comes with making decisions and taking risks. However, it's important to remember that not all negative feedback is destructive or unhelpful. Some feedback can be constructive and provide valuable insights for personal growth and development.\r\n\r\nTo help you manage your fear of negative backlash, I'd like to suggest a few strategies. First, it's crucial to focus on your intentions and motivations. When making decisions, try to approach situations from a place of compassion, empathy, and understanding. This mindset can help you feel more confident and grounded, even when faced with potential criticism.\r\n\r\nSecond, it's essential to practice self-compassion and self-care. Remember that making mistakes and experiencing setbacks is a natural part of life. Instead of dwelling on negative feedback, try to learn from it and focus on your strengths and accomplishments.\r\n\r\nLastly, it may be helpful to seek support from trusted friends, family members, or a mental health professional. Sharing your concerns and feelings with others can provide valuable perspective and help you gain a new perspective on your situation.\r\n\r\nIn summary, while the fear of negative backlash can be a challenging emotion to navigate, it's essential to remember that it's a common experience. By focusing on your intentions, practicing self-compassion, and seeking support from others, you can develop effective strategies to manage this emotion and grow from the experience."

         "My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.\r\nHowever, it’s intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?",

         "https://counselchat.com/therapists/kristi-king-morgan-lmsw",
         "<p>What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &#34;triangulation&#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &#34;triangulated&#34; by your wife and mother.</p><p>This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.</p><p>I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.</p><p>If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. </p><p>Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. </p><p>Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. They will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further.</p>",

         "<p>Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.</p><p>For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.</p><p>You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (&#34;Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.&#34;), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.</p><p>I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.</p><p>Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!</p>",

         "<p>Hi there. It's great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don't lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle, right? </p><p>What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, &#34;I'm too pushy&#34;, can be rewritten as, &#34;I'm assertive and I go after what I want.&#34; It can be hard to do since we tend to get &#34;stuck&#34; in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.</p><p>Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that's not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. You've already taken the first step, so keep moving forward.</p>",

Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous, but I haven't heard of any that cause mouth blisters, so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you've suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.</p><p>But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you don't have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting &#34;Ohm&#34; to meditate. It's about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don't give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you. Like medication, you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation.</p><p>I hope this helps and best of luck to you.</p>",

And for lots of reasons...most of them having something to do with beginning to take one another for granted and no longer doing the little things that nourish the relationship and light our partners up. &nbsp;Seems like you've encountered this in your own relationship...where he appears to be neglecting your need for emotional connection with him.</p><p>Doesn't have to be this way though. And from my own personal clinical experience, I can tell you that when even ONE partner is willing to make some small but powerful changes, they can often ripple outward to the other partner and bring about miraculous outcomes!&nbsp;</p><p>So my encouragement to you is this - if you're still in love with him...even a little bit...and you're down to try something new, there's hope! &nbsp;As hard as it may be, I would ask you to try and focus on YOUR own side of the street when approaching him.

How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?",
         "<p>One of the sometimes difficult things about being in a relationship is the fact that you can make goals for yourself, but you can't make goals for your partner. If your fiancé wants to learn to live more in the present and learn to let go of the past or move in a different direction, you can certainly assist him, but you can't independently make it happen.</p><p>I wonder if both of you would be willing to have a discussion where he is able to explain to you what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five, 10, 15 minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change, but just listening (kind of like an investigative reporter) so you can have more details and ask questions that you may have about what certain things mean, when it feels like to to him when this is discussed, etc. At that point, maybe he would willing to listen to your thoughts on the subject as well.</p><p>Also, if he wants to make a change, it may be helpful to see a therapist who specializes in working with couples. Sometimes changes such as these require a great deal of personal awareness and there can be quite a bit of emotions attached, so it is often helpful to have someone there to assist.</p><p>It may also be nice to have a discussion where you consider what makes you feel valued, appreciated, special, or loved, and also consider what makes your fiancé feel that way.</p>"

         "<p>Hi! Great question! My suggestion would be to google therapists in your area. &nbsp;One great website is called Psychology Today, which is a National site. &nbsp;You can search for therapists in your zip code and search more specifically for the issue you are seeking support about. &nbsp;It's a great way to find out if they therapist has a speciality, accepts insurance and whether they offer a free phone consultation. I would then make a list of the ones that may be a good fit and then give them a call! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Hope this helps. Remember you get to ask anything you need to, to determine if someone is a good fit. &nbsp;Don't be afraid to ask anything! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Best of luck!</p>"

I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.\r\nThe other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. \r\nI'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.",

         "<p>What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &#34;triangulation&#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &#34;triangulated&#34; by your wife and mother.</p><p>This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.</p><p>I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.</p><p>If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. </p><p>Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. </p><p>Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. They will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further.</p>"

         "What you are describing is something psychologists have termed \"triangulation\" which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been \"triangulated\" by your wife and mother. This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint. I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love. If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. They will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further."

         "Hi there. It's great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don't lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle, right? What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, \"I'm too pushy\", can be rewritten as, \"I'm assertive and I go after what I want.\" It can be hard to do since we tend to get \"stuck\" in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself. Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that's not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. You've already taken the first step, so keep moving forward."

         "Hi Cleveland, I think I get what you're feeling. You're scared that if you forgive your mom, that would mean it wasn't so bad, or she'll think it's okay to do it again, or she won't realize how hurt you are. I invite you to look at forgiveness in a different way. Forgiveness doesn't have to mean what she did was okay. Not at all. Forgiveness can mean \"I accept what she did, and I don't want to live in her worst moments constantly. I want to put it down and move past it because I want her in my life, because fear and resentment interfere with my relationship with her, and mostly because I'm tired of carrying them (fear and resentment) around constantly.\"You can forgive your mom for yourself, not for her.  If there is evidence that your mom wants to respect you moving forward, then it might be worth it to risk putting down the resentment and the grudge that you think you need to protect yourself.  Your ability to draw boundaries with her in the present is your biggest protector; let her know in the present what hurts you, and notice her responses. You don't have to say it to her face. Saying it to yourself is more important. Again, forgiving your mom helps you...it reduces your own burden of fear and resentment, leaving space for better things."

         "Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry about this life-altering situation that both you and your boyfriend are going through. To be sure, this is a devastating and lonely road for both of you. I say lonely because when things like this happen we often don't know what to say to each other, and so we suffer in silence with little support. Here are a few thoughts that I am having, and perhaps others will add things, too:1. By the sound of your main question, it seems like you have every intention to be there for your boyfriend during this difficult time. I am not sure if he is willing to talk about his health situation, but letting him know that you want to support him and also need his support may be helpful. 2. If it is possible, see if he would be willing to go to a counselor with you. There are many things that a counselor could focus on that may help your relationship, but also help you both cope with what is happening. 3. If he refuses to seek support, you may want to consider going on your own. If you can't afford it, sometimes hospice organizations offer support groups and other services. It is very important not to neglect yourself. Be well,Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"

There are different types; however, so here is a website that gives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder: http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression?page=2After reviewing these symptoms, if you believe you may have bipolar disorder, then you may want to see your primary care provider or a counselor. Bipolar disorder is treatable, but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management. For example, some people may not get regular sleep, but proper rest is important for bipolar management. A counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make. The good news is that many people live happy, healthy, and productive lives with bipolar disorder. So, if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder, it doesn't mean that things can't get better. There is currently no \"cure\" for bipolar disorder, but with proper medication and lifestyle management, people can do quite well. Hope this was helpful. Be well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"

         "My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the \"straight and narrow\" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially  that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others. \r\n\r\nHis insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?",
         "This suffering and clinging to the past, especially a troubled past or a past that we dont like, may be  amplified due to the Christian framework that may be built into your life. I am not averse to religion, i just think that many times it puts unreasonable expectations on us and helps us to form a guilt complex or perhaps even insecurities, we are humans and humans make mistakes. you mention the straight and narrow, this is a notion that you must give up on and let go, humans can never travel the straight and narrow for their whole lives there are bounds to be mistakes, we are the most fallible species on the planet and please tell your fiance to have some mercy on himself, he is not perfect. Here is a story about clinging on to things you may find useful to mediate on:Once\r\nthere lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal\r\nriver. The current of the river swept silently over them all -- young and\r\nold, rich and poor, good and evil -- the current going its own way, knowing\r\nonly its own crystal self.\r\nEach creature in its own\r\nmanner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom, for clinging\r\nwas their way of life, and resisting the current was what each had learned\r\nfrom birth.\r\nBut one creature said\r\nat last, \"I am tired of clinging. Though I cannot see it with my eyes,\r\nI trust that the current knows where it is going. I shall let go, and let\r\nit take me where it will. Clinging, I shall die of boredom.\"\r\nThe other creatures laughed\r\nand said, \"Fool! Let go, and that current you worship will throw you tumbled\r\nand smashed against the rocks, and you will die quicker than boredom!\"\r\nBut the one heeded them\r\nnot, and taking a breath did let go, and at once was tumbled and smashed\r\nby the current across the rocks.\r\nYet in time, as the creature\r\nrefused to cling again, the current lifted him free from the bottom, and\r\nhe was bruised and hurt no more.\r\nAnd the creatures downstream,\r\nto whom he was a stranger, cried, \"See a miracle! A creature like ourselves,\r\nyet he flies! See the messiah, come to save us all!\"\r\nAnd the one carried in\r\nthe current said, \"I am no more messiah than you. The river delights to\r\nlift us free, if only we dare let go. Our true work is this voyage, this\r\nadventure.\"\r\nBut they cried the more,\r\n\"Savior!\" all the while clinging to the rocks, and when they looked again\r\nhe was gone, and they were left alone making legends of a savior."

         "Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. \r\nWhen I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety. \r\nAm I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.",
         "You need to find an outlet. Someone to talk to. Your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal. But anyone could help. Just look to someone for help. If you can't find anyone who you think will listen, talk to your mom. It can help greatly just to get the words out. Tell her how you feel about her passing, but then also about everything else. Talk to her about your day. Tell her about happy things. I don't know if you're a religious person, or where you believe she is now, but no matter what you can talk to her."

         "<HUMAN>: What is a panic attack?\n<ASSISTANT>: Panic attacks come on suddenly and involve intense and often overwhelming fear. They’re accompanied by very challenging physical symptoms, like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea. Unexpected panic attacks occur without an obvious cause. Expected panic attacks are cued by external stressors, like phobias. Panic attacks can happen to anyone, but having more than one may be a sign of panic disorder, a mental health condition characterized by sudden and repeated panic attacks."

         "<HUMAN>: What are symptoms of panic attack vs. anxiety attack?\n<ASSISTANT>: Panic attacks and anxiety attacks can share some similarities, but they also have distinct features. It's important to remember that I am not a medical professional, and if you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, seeking help from a qualified healthcare professional is essential.\n\nPanic Attack Symptoms:\nA panic attack is a sudden and intense surge of fear or discomfort that reaches its peak within minutes. Some common symptoms of a panic attack include:\n\n1. Heart palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.\n2. Sweating or trembling.\n3. Shortness of breath or feeling smothered.\n4. Feeling of choking or a lump in the throat.\n5. Chest pain or discomfort.\n6. Nausea or abdominal distress.\n7. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint.\n8. Chills or hot flashes.\n9. Numbness or tingling sensations.\n10. Fear of losing control or going crazy.\n11. Fear of dying.\n12. A sense of detachment from reality or oneself (depersonalization).\n13. A feeling of being detached from the surroundings (derealization).\n\nIt's important to note that panic attacks are often unpredictable and can occur even in situations where there is no immediate danger.\n\nAnxiety Attack Symptoms:\nAnxiety attacks are different from panic attacks in terms of intensity and duration. While panic attacks are sudden and reach their peak rapidly, anxiety attacks are typically associated with prolonged feelings of worry, nervousness, and fear. Symptoms of an anxiety attack may include:\n\n1. Excessive worrying or fear about future events or situations.\n2. Restlessness or feeling on edge.\n3. Muscle tension or aches.\n4. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.\n5. Irritability.\n6. Fatigue or feeling easily fatigued.\n7. Sleep disturbances, such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\n8. Avoidance of triggers or situations that provoke anxiety.\n\nAnxiety attacks can be triggered by specific stressors or occur without an apparent cause. They might build up gradually and persist for an extended period.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to consult a qualified mental health professional to obtain an accurate diagnosis and receive personalized guidance and support. They can help develop a suitable treatment plan to manage panic attacks, anxiety attacks, or any other mental health concerns you may be facing."

         "<HUMAN>: What are the types of Mental Illness?\n<ASSISTANT>: There are many different conditions that are recognized as mental illnesses. The more common types include:\n\n1. Anxiety disorders: People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. \n\n2. Mood disorders: These disorders, also called affective disorders, involve persistent feelings of sadness or periods of feeling overly happy, or fluctuations from extreme happiness to extreme sadness.\n\n3. Psychotic disorders: Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of psychotic disorders are hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder.\n\n4. Eating disorders: Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food.\n\n5. Personality disorders: People with personality disorders have extreme and inflexible personality traits that are distressing to the person and/or cause problems in work, school, or social relationships.\n\n6. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): People with OCD are plagued by constant thoughts or fears that cause them to perform certain rituals or routines. An example is a person with an unreasonable fear of germs who constantly washes their hands.\n\n7. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): PTSD is a condition that can develop following a traumatic and/or terrifying event, such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a natural disaster."

Here are some general guidelines and options:\n\n1. Seek Professional Help: It's essential to consult a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can conduct a thorough evaluation, provide a proper diagnosis, and tailor a treatment plan to address your unique concerns.\n\n2. Therapy or Counseling: Different types of therapy, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), or psychotherapy, can be effective in helping individuals cope with and overcome mental health challenges.\n\n3. Medication: In some cases, medication might be prescribed to alleviate symptoms and stabilize your mental health. This should always be done under the guidance of a qualified psychiatrist.\n\n4. Lifestyle Changes: Implementing healthy lifestyle choices can significantly impact mental well-being. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and stress reduction techniques can all play a crucial role.\n\n5. Social Support: Connecting with friends, family, or support groups can provide a sense of belonging and understanding, which can be beneficial in the recovery process.\n\n6. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Practices like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga can help manage stress and promote a sense of inner calm.\n\n7. Identify Triggers and Coping Strategies: Learning to identify triggers that worsen your condition and developing healthy coping mechanisms can empower you to better manage your symptoms.\n\n8. Education and Self-Help Resources: Educating yourself about your mental health condition and seeking self-help resources, such as books or online courses, can be empowering and enlightening.\n\nRemember, each person's journey to mental health is unique, so it's crucial to be patient with yourself and not compare your progress to others. Recovery is possible, and with the right support and dedication, you can lead a fulfilling life."
